# Overall plan for the computational book
## Use the sequential material presented in thirty class sections
- Show the 30 slide sets
- If possible, link to videos of the class presentations
- Provide full text of the slides
- Provide full transcipt of the videos
## Annotate each slide at the point of its use of numerical or quantitative material
- Suggest a Jupyter Notebook  (JN) to gather data and compute the numbers presented
- Introduce ChatGPT in an interactive window, to allow the student to explore alternative Python codes for the JN
- Use ChatGPT to explore broader factual questions (note that it is often wrong)
## Suggest expert sources and extended research links
- Cite California water documents
- Cite AWWA documents
- Cite journal articles; Science, Nature, 
##  Place the slide, or the entire presentation in a wider context
- Cite basic questions to be answered. Note two strands: factual, empirical experience: **how to**, and  analytical: **why it happens**, derived from analytics: physics, chemistry, environmental engineering fundamentals
## Examples: 
- What are the foundations?
- Where does the water come from?
- Where does the water go?
- What did it cost to build?
- What will it cost to rebuild?
- How would we do it if we started today?
- How can we disaggregate water use and the energy used to move and heat it?
- Who is going to pay? When? How much? 
- Who has been underpaying? Who has been overpaying? How do we rebalance the equation?
