# Challenges
## **Challenge**: our most critical infrastructure is invisible, taken for granted, assumed just to work. But we are close to systemic failure.


- **Unanticipated climate change** creates accelerating stress to interconnected water and energy systems. **Drought, fire, and flood** overwhelm existing planning models. Emergency planning fails to anticipate critical shortages.  We must completely reexamine water and energy infrastructure investments, taken together, to design and build a more sustainable future.
-  **Political and governmental agencies** fail to understand inevitable impending water and energy shortages; inadequate analysis based on out-dated tools and assumptions leads to serious policy and planning mistakes.  New tools, new data, and new analysis must lead to more effective investments.
- Today's **outmoded construction standards** create a major legacy of unanticipated costs.
  - Mistaking reliability for resilience means our existing infrastructure is built in a way that makes rebuilding and replacement many times too expensive. Future construction plans must be re-evaluated and redesigned to enable ease of repair, real-time monitoring, anticipatory maintenance and risk-based replacement. All past construction--each pipe segment, pump, tank, valve, joint--must be re-examined, then ranked for risk of failure and prioritized for replacement.
- **Interdependent water and energy infrastructure should no longer be managed as independent entities.**
