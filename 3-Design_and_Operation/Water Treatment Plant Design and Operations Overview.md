- p.4: California groundwater chart: regional
- p.11: WTP flow per plant; picture: need chart
- p.15: WWTP: pretreatment flow: JN to show real time tuning? velocities? turbidities?
- p.21: Ozone treatment schematic: flows? 
- p.22: filtration: schematic
- p.24: corrosion control: monitoring? sensors? pH? temp?
- p.26: residuals: volumes? sales?
- p.30: inactivation and log removal: flow of info? how monitored? chart: inline removal; EPA;  EBMUD?
- p.37: drought affects organics residual; more disinfection, more DBP; chlorine byproducts; chart Q1-13 to Q2-18; peak Q2 17;
- p.38: chart : reduce DBP: process costs
- p.39: Orinda UV; shows targets; how monitored? 
- Can JN show overall process of altering treatment process? show costs vs benefits? show real time monitoring?
- p.50: more sources: check for any quantitative charts
