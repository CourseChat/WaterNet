				- Water and Wastewater Systems Operations
				- p.8: rainfall map vs population map; colored
				- p.14: infectious disease rate: CDC; 1900-1996; chlorine: 1913; chart
				- p.20: list of innovations: could show impact on system operation
					- InPipe Energy
					- Wedeco: UV reactor
					- URS AECOM Hayward fault crossing
				- p.22: GPR ground penetrating radar; could use data to build out street 3D diagrams; proximity data for breaks; 
				- p.23: satellite leak; automated fire hydrant acoustic; manual acoustic; where does data go? how integrated into existing databases? JN to integrate? 
				- p.31: pie chart: nitrogen in central SF bay: 10% stormwater; 20% EBMUD; 70% other treated: no source shown; find sources; find monitors; show real-time, from sensors; JN
				- p.35; Recycling map; 
				- p.37: WWTP: showing turbidity: real-time sensor data? JN
				- p.39: Resource Recovery: septage: $1.75; Liquid Organic: $2.90; brine: $4.90; similar for SF? chart 2002 - 2022 showing recovery percent.
				- p.42: urban runoff: 0.6 MGD: when? shows loading
				- If we were going to build it today: different weighting of priorities:  similar to Clifford's resilience vs reliability;
				- build JN to show
