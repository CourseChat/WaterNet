# WaterNet: building an interactive text utilizing Jupyter notebooks to analyze all aspects of a modern water utility
- Based on civil engineering lectures given at UC Berkeley in Fall, 2022 by Professor Kenichi Soga, EBMUD General Director Clifford Chan, and thirty top engineers at EBMUD.
- Subject to major revisons. Each chapter is being rewritten to incorporate Jupyter Notebooks to generate real-time data analysis.
## This compilation of materials presented in UC Berkeley's Civil Engineering 112 course is provided as a framework to extend to additional courses on management of water resources.
