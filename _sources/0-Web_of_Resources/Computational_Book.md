# Overall plan for the computational book
## Goal: provide a computational cell for every number or quantitative relationship
- Execute the Jupyter Notebook on any of five sites:
    - user's local machine
    - JupyterHub running at EBMUD for internal use
    - JupyterHub running at UC Berkeley for researchers, students, Center for Smart Infractructure
    - Google Colabs: move entire site there so it's accessible, and computable, by general public
    - Binder site

## Use the material presented in thirty class sections as foundation
- Show the 30 presentation decks; allow JN builders to annotate, develop JN to produce same results
- If possible, link to videos of the class presentations
- Provide full text of the slides
- Provide full transcipt of the videos
- Provide URL or reference of data source for every number used
## Annotate each slide: show each use of data at the point of its use
- Allow JN builders to find their assignment
- Create a Jupyter Notebook (JN) to gather data and compute the numbers presented
- Introduce ChatGPT in an interactive window, to allow the student to explore alternative Python codes for the JN
- Use ChatGPT to explore broader factual questions (note that it is often wrong)
- Use ChatGPT to generate Python code to explore each computation, visualization, and extension
## Suggest expert sources; journals; trade magazines; water-related conferences;  extended research links
- Cite California water documents
- Cite AWWA documents
- Cite journal articles; Science, Nature, 
- ETH-Zurich; EAWAG; University of Tokyo; Tsingh-Hua; 
##  Place the slide, or the entire presentation in a wider context
- Cite basic questions to be answered. Note two strands: factual, empirical experience: **how to**, and  analytical: **why it happens**, derived from analytics: physics, chemistry, environmental engineering fundamentals
## Examples: 
- What are the foundations?
- Where does the water come from?
- Where does the water go?
- What did it cost to build?
- What will it cost to rebuild?
- How would we do it if we started from the beginning today?
- How can we model the interrelationship between water use and energy used to move and heat it?
- Who is going to pay for water use? For water capital rebuilding? 
- What financial tools can generate adequate funding? How? When? How much? 
- Who has been underpaying? Who has been overpaying? How do we rebalance the equation?
