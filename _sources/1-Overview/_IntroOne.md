# Trouble in River City: No Money, and Everything is Falling Down
## Introduction To How We Got Here
- If everything is out of sight, how can anyone be convinced to pay for it? 
- Taxes are the price of living with drinkable water
## Water utilities require major new investments to keep clean water flowing. We must rebuild and extend our critical water infrastructure now.  This investment is not yet funded.
  - Dams, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, water collection systems and water and waste water purification **systems will require from two to five times more investment** than today's conservative financial models anticipate.
## Faced with massive challenges from climate change and ancient infrastructure, our utilities battle each day to protect our health. But thousands of water main breaks a day in California show we are losing ground.
- Today's **aging, failing infrastructure** requires capital investment beyond existing budgets. Even the best-managed utilities see unanticipated shortfalls due to changing weather patterns, mounting energy costs, shifting water sources, new pollution challenges, and shocks to supply chains.
  - **These investments can not be avoided or postponed.** (Think Ukraine this winter) (Insert total past capital investment, total required annual rebuilding estimates: US, EU, China, India, Sub-Saharan Africa, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Middle East)
