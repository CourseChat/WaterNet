- JN for forcasting demand for Westside: commercial sector
- Normalize with drought time periods
- how different customer classes are affected by drought or economy
- Part 2: Forecast: JN: high demand scenario from Excel file; low demand; estimate need for water from table of existing supply, rationing policy; timing; what assumptions heavily influence need?;
- part 4: Available Water Supply: Westside options: cost per AF; make table of supply options;
- Part 5: portfolio of supplies that meet forecasted need by Westside at least cost; make chart to compare portfolio to demand;  if transfers and groundwater don't work; how to change portfolio; can high demand be met: how to augment?

## Develop iterative Jupter Notebook, adding more disaggregated data at each stage. I.e., use partner water utility data on demands, flows, reservoir capacities. Note risks to Central Valley transmission lines, so add risk calculations
- What is the cost of decentralization, of islanding of storage?
