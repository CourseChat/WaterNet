 
# CE112 Water & Wastewater Systems Design and Operation 

:::{note}
Part A of this JupyterBook recreates all presentations made in Fall, 2022 in Civil Engineering 112: _Water and Wastewater Systems Design and Operation_. In a carefully designed collaboratin with UC Berkeley faculty, thirty senior engineers from EBMUD present the core planning, design, operation, and financing of a one-billion-dollar annual operating budget organization responsible for continuous clean water supply to a million and a half person population. EBMUD, in partnership with nine cities, treats wastewater for half that population.

Part B of this JupyterBook builds on this foundation to explore innovations and challenges for the next 100 years. Its goal: explore new research on water engineering: materials, construction, water quality, water reuse, water efficiency.  Incorporate new tools of real-time data flows and analysis, develop responsive models of the operating plant as it responds to changes in weather, climate, and potential disasters, and explore new ways of rebuilding for resilience. Evaluate the financial impact of rising sea level and groundwater tables, drought, and the challenge of rebuilding critical water and power infrastructure. Recent extreme weather events lend urgency to the fundamental challenge: how to provide clean, healthy water and sanitation to everyone with justice, equal access, and an equitable sharing of costs and risks.

Course Description: Water and wastewater systems serving communities are complex, large, and were built and expanded over many decades. The infrastructure includes a network of reservoirs, pipelines, 
pump stations, treatment plants, and other facilities that are connected to natural systems such as watersheds, rivers, groundwater basins, and bay and o cean environments. The planning, design, operation, and maintenance of urban water and wastewater systems require balancing many factors including aging infrastructure, changing regulations, climate change, costs, and community impacts. 
 
One of the greatest challenges facing civil engineers in the 21st century is the stewardship 
of the infrastructure to protect public health and the environment . Existing systems require 
monitoring or remedial interventions and are placed under increased stress, more than for which they were
 originally designed. In addition, the high cost of replacement often leads to a desire to extend the asset’s life. This course will provide an opportunity to learn about real water 
and wastewater systems and how the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) 
rehabilitates or builds infrastructure that is sustainable and resilient so that future 
generations do not experience the infrastructure challenges we are currently facing today. 

To achieve this, we need to better understand how the infrastructure functions as a system. 
In this project-based course, students will research and investigate how to introduce innovations in the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance of water 
and wastewater systems, and develop community resilience against natural/manmade 
hazards through robust resilience planning and design. 
 
Learning Activities: In collaboration with Berkeley professors and EBMUD subject matter experts, this project-based course will cover the following topics: 

(1) Infrastructure design, maintenance, and replacement, 
(2) Water and wastewater systems operations, 
(3) Water supply and natural resources, 
(4) Climate change, sustainability, and resilience, and 
(5) Emergency/Community preparedness . 

There will be five field trips to visit the EBMUD facilities to see how innovations are introduced. Working with EBMUD staff, students will 
examine how to apply engineering concepts to introduce emerging technologies such as intelligent systems and networks, remote sensing and monitoring, and data analytics for decision-making into water and wastewater systems.  
 
Lecture notes: Presentations, notes and supplementary reports will be posted in Courses. 
 
Course Materials:  Various reading materials will be assigned to enhance lecture information and overall knowledge of the course materials.

 (

 
HW Assignments: Eight assignments to learn the tools introduced in class, to conduct data analysis and to discuss the analysis results. Some tasks are conducted in groups, but assignments will be submitted individually unless otherwise instructed. The objective of the assignments is to 
expand the student’s capabilities to conduct data analysis correctly and to examine the results critically. The assignments will be given on a regular basis (every 1 -2 weeks) and due on one to two weeks later. All must be completed prior to the final exam week. 
Penalties will be given for late work (0.5 points/day). 
 
Quizzes: Quizzes will be given after each field trip to an EBMUD facility and provide an opportunity for students to report on the findings from the site visits. The purpose of the quizzes is to elevate the student’s overall understanding of the course materials. No points are assigned 
for late submission. 
 
Group project: Groups of two students will work together with EBMUD subject matter experts on solving their problems using appropriate emerging technologies. A final report will be submitted to conclude the course . 
 
Weighting for grade: Eight assignments (7 points x 8 = 56 points ), Five quizzes (4 points x 5 = 20 points ) and 
project presentation and report (24 points ). Please report to Prof Soga and GSI for illness and family emergencies. 


 UC Berkeley Honor Code : See UC Berkeley’s code of conduct (sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct) for the standards for academic honesty and penalties for infractions. Students need act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Also, it is not allowed to make or distribute copies of recorded audio or video lectures without written permission. 
 It is acceptable to discuss the assignments and quizzes with other students, or with the lecturers and GSI. Such discussions are beneficial and are to be encouraged. However, one student’s work cannot be used by another. For example, it is unacceptable for two students to submit effectively identical computer codes. Analysis of the data, production of graphs for the write-up, and all written sections of the report must be done individually. The named author of a report must have made the main contribution to the work submitted and the report must be in his or her own words.  
Violating the honor code will result in referral to the OFFICE OF STUDENT CONDUCT for further disciplinary action, possibly including suspension or expulsion. 
Violating the honor code will result in a grade of “F” for the course.
