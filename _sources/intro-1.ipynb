    "Six atmospheric rivers brought EBMUD out of drought restrictions. Three more comining in January, with Sierra snow depth doubling, raises system storage to near-capacity. Summer snow melt predictions almost double. Graph shows model predictions for alternate possibilities, from January to October 2023. Similar pattern last year had drought after March, so these predictions are conservative. Most of this rainfall cannot be stored. Some reservoirs must be drained to avoid overtopping. In future editions, today's system storage will draw directly from real-time levels at Pardee and other reservoirs.  Will add estimates of total water flow to Pacific and groundwater replenishment.\n",
