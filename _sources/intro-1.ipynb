    "Six atmospheric rivers brought EBMUD out of drought restrictions. Three more comining in January, with Sierra snow depth doubling, raises system storage to near-capacity. Summer snow melt predictions almost double. Graph shows model predictions for alternate possibilities, from January to October 2023. Similar pattern last year had drought after March, so these predictions are conservative. Most of this rainfall cannot be stored. Some reservoirs must be drained to avoid overtopping. In future editions, today's system storage will draw directly from real-time levels at Pardee and other reservoirs.  Will add estimates of total water flow to Pacific and groundwater replenishment.\n",

But designs and budgets that worked in the past are no longer sufficient for maintaining global water supplies. The infrastructure is failing. Here's how to approach needed change.\n",

With current technologies, rebuilding a system similar to EBMUD--1.5 million daily users, \\$1 billion annual expenses, 80 MGD flow, 250 MG storage--over a 25-year period, will cost $20 billion in 2022 dollars. \n",

Financing is possible only by building an accurate estimate of costs, to enable investors to make an accurate comparison to the costs of not rebuilding. Rebuilding at today's rate will take 140 years.[^2]\n",

Even the best-managed utilities see unanticipated shortfalls due to changing weather patterns, mounting energy costs, shifting water sources, new pollution challenges, and shocks to supply chains.\n",
