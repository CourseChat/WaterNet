    "Six atmospheric rivers brought EBMUD out of drought restrictions in the first weeks of January, 2023. Three more came in January.  Sierra snow depth doubled, raising system storage to near-capacity. Summer snow melt predictions doubled. Graph shows model predictions for alternate possibilities, from January to October 2023. Similar pattern last year had drought after March, so these predictions are conservative. Most of this rainfall cannot be stored. Floods must be diverted. Some reservoirs must be drained to avoid overtopping. In future editions, today's system storage will draw directly from real-time levels at Pardee and other reservoirs.  This edition Will add estimates of total water flow to Pacific and groundwater replenishment, in real time.\n",

Financing is possible only by building an accurate estimate of costs, to enable investors to make an accurate comparison to the costs of not rebuilding. Rebuilding at today's rate will take 140 years.[^2]\n",

Even the best-managed utilities see unanticipated shortfalls due to changing weather patterns, mounting energy costs, shifting water sources, new pollution challenges, and shocks to supply chains.\n",
