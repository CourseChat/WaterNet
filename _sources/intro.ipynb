    "- Every water utility around the world invests to bring clean water to everyone.  Existing subsurface capital investments are in the trillions of dollars. But designs and budgets that worked in the past are no longer sufficient for maintaining global water supplies. The infrastructure is failing. Here's how to approach needed change.\n",

    "### Water utilities require major new investments to keep clean water flowing. We must rebuild and extend our critical water infrastructure now.  But this investment is not yet funded. \n",
    "- Past cost projections are proving to be wildly inaccurate due to new challenges of climate change and rapidly aging capital plant.\n",
    "- Dams, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, water collection systems and water and waste water purification **systems will require from two to five times more investment** than today's conservative financial models anticipate. [^1]\n",
    "[^1]: AWWA and ASME estimates\n",
    "- This site will build increasingly detailed cost projections for complete system renewal. With current technologies, rebuilding a system similar to EBMUD--1.5 million daily users, \\$1 billion annual expenses, ..... MGD flow, .... MG storage--over a 25-year period, will cost $20 billion in 2022 dollars. \n",
    "- We will build the outline of the necessary campaign to finance this cost, by tax, by rate change, by bond issue, by cost savings, by redesign of capital plant.  Financing this amount is possible only by building an extremely accurate estimate of costs, to enable an accurate comparison to the costs of not rebuilding. Rebuilding at today's rate will take 140 years.[^2]\n",
    "[^2]: From EBMUD Capital Investments Plan, 2022--at rate of 30 pipeline miles replaced each year, over 4,500 miles of existing distribtion pipe network\n",
    "- But, what if innovation could cut projected costs by a factor of two? That is, save $10 billion of projected investment. Could fundamental realignment of management of underground critical infrastructure change how we invest? As contrast, examine urban infrastructure in cities that built new systems in the past thirty years.[^3]\n",

    "### Faced with massive challenges from climate change and ancient infrastructure, our utilities battle each day to protect our health. But hundreds of water main breaks a day in California show we are losing ground. What is our best investment?\n",
    "- Today's **aging, failing infrastructure** requires capital investment beyond existing budgets. Even the best-managed utilities see unanticipated shortfalls due to changing weather patterns, mounting energy costs, shifting water sources, new pollution challenges, and shocks to supply chains.\n",
    "  - **These investments can not be avoided or postponed.** (Think Ukraine this winter) (Insert total past capital investment, total required annual rebuilding estimates: US, EU, China, India, Sub-Saharan Africa, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Middle East)\n",

    "## **Challenge**: our most critical infrastructure is invisible, taken for granted, assumed just to work. But we are moving closer to systemic failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unanticipated climate change** creates accelerating stress to interconnected water and energy systems. **Drought, fire, and flood** overwhelm existing planning models. Emergency planning fails to anticipate critical shortages.  We must completely reexamine water and energy infrastructure investments, taken together, to design and build a more sustainable future.\n",
    "-  **Political and governmental agencies** fail to understand inevitable impending water and energy shortages; inadequate analysis based on out-dated tools and assumptions leads to serious policy and planning mistakes.  New tools, new data, and new analysis must lead to more effective investments.\n",
    "- Today's **outmoded construction standards** create a major legacy of unanticipated costs.\n",
    "  - Mistaking reliability for resilience means our existing infrastructure is built in a way that makes rebuilding and replacement many times too expensive. Future construction plans must be re-evaluated and redesigned to enable ease of repair, real-time monitoring, anticipatory maintenance and risk-based replacement. All past construction--each pipe segment, pump, tank, valve, joint--must be re-examined, then ranked for risk of failure and prioritized for replacement.\n",
    "- **Interdependent water and energy infrastructure should no longer be managed as independent entities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "### New data networks allows real-time management of risks and investment\n",
    "- New systems of high resolution satellite and drone surveillance, soil and seismic monitoring, geotechnical and hydrological testing and modeling, **ubiquitous sensor deployment and networked data acquisition** from all elements of our physical plant transform how we manage daily operations.  Data-based risk assessment shapes the replacement design of our critical infrastructure. **New data networks are orders of magnitude cheaper than past systems**; new tools of machine learning and data analysis **reveal developing vulnerabilities and risks in real time**. New materials, new methods of production, new technologies of construction, and new regulatory and reporting requirements are transforming the modern water and energy utility.\n",
    "- These new capabilities support targeted decision-making for risk-based investments. New data brings new opportunities for cost-effective civil engineering.  \n",
    "- **Change comes slowly in critical infrastructure engineering.** Innovations must be tested, over long time periods, before general adoption by those responsible for the basic functioning of modern society.\n",
    "- **Financial investment in often-invisible infrastructure must come from informed public opinion**, based on accurate assessments of costs.  But new circumstances require new initiatives.\n",
    "- **The global workforce that creates and maintains our most critical infrastructure must be given new resources, new tools,  new technologies, new training and career advancement, and a new regulatory framework**."
