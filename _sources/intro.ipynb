With current technologies, rebuilding a system similar to EBMUD--1.5 million daily users, \\$1 billion annual expenses, ..... MGD flow, .... MG storage--over a 25-year period, will cost $20 billion in 2022 dollars. \n",
    "- We will build the outline of the necessary campaign to finance this cost, by tax, by rate change, by bond issue, by cost savings, by redesign of capital plant.  Financing this amount is possible only by building an extremely accurate estimate of costs, to enable an accurate comparison to the costs of not rebuilding. Rebuilding at today's rate will take 140 years.[^2]\n",

New tools, new data, and new analysis must lead to more effective investments.\n",
    "- Today's **outmoded construction standards** create a major legacy of unanticipated costs.\n",
    "  - Mistaking reliability for resilience means our existing infrastructure is built in a way that makes rebuilding and replacement many times too expensive. Future construction plans must be re-evaluated and redesigned to enable ease of repair, real-time monitoring, anticipatory maintenance and risk-based replacement. All past construction--each pipe segment, pump, tank, valve, joint--must be re-examined, then ranked for risk of failure and prioritized for replacement.\n",

    "- New systems of high resolution satellite and drone surveillance, soil and seismic monitoring, geotechnical and hydrological testing and modeling, **ubiquitous sensor deployment and networked data acquisition** from all elements of our physical plant transform how we manage daily operations.  Data-based risk assessment shapes the replacement design of our critical infrastructure. **New data networks are orders of magnitude cheaper than past systems**; new tools of machine learning and data analysis **reveal developing vulnerabilities and risks in real time**. New materials, new methods of production, new technologies of construction, and new regulatory and reporting requirements are transforming the modern water and energy utility.\n",
    "- These new capabilities support targeted decision-making for risk-based investments. New data brings new opportunities for cost-effective civil engineering.  \n",
    "- **Change comes slowly in critical infrastructure engineering.** Innovations must be tested, over long time periods, before general adoption by those responsible for the basic functioning of modern society.\n",
    "- **Financial investment in often-invisible infrastructure must come from informed public opinion**, based on accurate assessments of costs.  But new circumstances require new initiatives.\n",
