      "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;\" and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\n",
      "behave?\"  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",
      "grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\n",
      "company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\n",
      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\n",
      "a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there.  That was good!\n",
      " Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",

      "\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who dah?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?\" and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",
      "and I made my mark on the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" says Ben Rogers, \"what's the line of business of this Gang?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing only robbery and murder,\" Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\"\n",
      "says Tom Sawyer.  \"We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  We\n",
      "are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we always kill the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\n",
      "the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ransomed?  What's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in books; and so\n",
      "of course that's what we've got to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it.  Don't I tell you it's in the\n",
      "books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,\n",
      "and get things all muddled up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\n",
      "are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it\n",
      "to them?--that's the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it\n",
      "is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,\n",
      "it means that we keep them till they're dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, that's something _like_.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't you said\n",
      "that before?  We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a\n",
      "bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\n",
      "to get loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there's a guard\n",
      "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody's got to set up all night\n",

      "quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver\n",

      "from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\n",
      "would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt\n",
      "it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\n",
      "would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\n",
      "and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\n",

      "going to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix\n",

      "behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\n",

      "of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give\n",

      "crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\n",
      "one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes.  He started\n",
      "and run round and round the cabin, hollering \"Take him off! take him\n",
      "off! he's biting me on the neck!\"  I never see a man look so wild in the\n",

      "and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\n",
      "saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid\n",
      "still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.\n",
      " I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it\n",
      "seemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he\n",
      "raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,\n",
      "very low:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming\n",

      "off--they're cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\n",
      "alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\n",
      "old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\n",

      "and then I couldn't come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I\n",
      "was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and\n",
      "cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and\n",
      "dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\n",
      "shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\n",
      "as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\n",

      "great times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be\n",

      "high like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,\n",
      "clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected\n",
      "there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\n",
      "to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd\n",
      "raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a\n",
      "drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks\n",

      "'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river\n",
      "about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\n",
      "rough time tramping on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\n",

      "that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and\n",
      "then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines\n",
      "and went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\n",
      "wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\n",

      "About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The\n",
      "river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\n",
      "rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\n",
      " We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.\n",
      "Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\n",
      "more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one\n",
      "time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and\n",
      "took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\n",
      " I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he\n",
      "had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\n",
      "log again.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the\n",
      "hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\n",
      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",
      "at that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five\n",
      "foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\n",
      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\n",
      "followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\n",
      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",

      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\"  I heard that just as plain\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of \"boom!\" away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was \"baker's bread\"--what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",
      " Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      " I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doan' hurt me--don't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\n",

      "awluz yo' fren'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so\n",
      "glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",
      "truck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den\n",
      "strawbries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says.  \"Is that what you live on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn' git nuffn else,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come heah de night arter you's killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, all that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--indeedy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sah--nuffn else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de\n",
      "islan'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the night I got killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got\n",
      "a gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",
      "with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\n",
      "with his knife, and fried him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\n",
      "when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\n",
      "that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\n",
      "because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty\n",
      "soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\n",
      "right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",
      "glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\n",
      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",
      "under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where\n",
      "it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jim, this is nice,\" I says.  \"I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but\n",

      "The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\n",
      "last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on\n",
      "the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side\n",
      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",
      "old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a\n",
      "wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\n",
      "and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We\n",
      "went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\n",
      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\n",
      "slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",
      "We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\n",
      "floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De man ain't asleep--he's dead.  You hold still--I'll go en see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n",

      "\"It's a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He's ben shot in de back.\n",
      "I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan' look\n",
      "at his face--it's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      " There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",
      "too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a\n",
      "boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there\n",
      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",
      "baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was\n",
      "a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They\n",
      "stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.\n",
      " The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\n",
      "hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",
      "and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\n",
      "monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\n",
      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",
      "and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps\n",
      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",
      "it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find\n",
      "the other one, though we hunted all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to\n",
      "shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\n",
      "broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\n",
      "quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\n",
      "ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\n",
      "a half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and\n",

      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\n",

      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\n",
      "every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n",

      " I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\n",
      "I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\n",
      "tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",

      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my\n",

      "out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",

      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\n",

      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",

      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",

      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",

      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",

      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",

      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",

      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\n",

      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\n",

      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",

      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\n",

      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain't nothing to watch but\n",

      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\"  Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  \"And besides,\" I says,\n",
      "\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      " Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\n",

      "_was_ here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",

      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!\"\n",

      "\"It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said\n",

      "this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      " This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you\n",

      "\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\n",
      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",

      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",

      "didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted\n",

      "\n",

      "after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\n",

      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\n",
      "self.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\n",
      " I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?\"\n",

      "I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\n",

      "\n",

      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\n",
      "men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\n",
      "camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a\n",
      "power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman\n",

      "\n",
      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\n",
      "hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\n",
      "both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We\n",
      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\n",
      "it.  I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but\n",
      "about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit\n",
      "up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two\n",
      "big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe\n",
      "we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the\n",
      "same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question\n",
      "was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\n",
      "and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\n",
      "was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to\n",

      "\n",
      "There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\n",
      "not pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\n",
      "because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\n",

      "enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with\n",
      "Cairo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\n",
      "take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to wait\n",
      "for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no\n",

      "a canoe to go back in.  We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't\n",
      "anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\n",

      "\n",
      "The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we\n",

      "more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\n",
      "meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she\n",
      "would see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they\n",
      "go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\n",
      "nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she\n",
      "was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see\n",
      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\n",
      "cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\n",
      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\n",
      "overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\n",
      "through the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\n",
      "had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could\n",
      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\n",
      "minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",
      "churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\n",
      "could hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\n",
      "so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water,\" and\n",
      "struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see\n",
      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\n",
      "long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to\n",
      "rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to.  I took one slow step at\n",

      "little and a little more till somebody said, \"There, that's enough--put\n",

      "they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,\n",
      "and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front\n",
      "windows--there warn't none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a\n",
      "good look at me, and all said, \"Why, _he_ ain't a Shepherdson--no, there\n",
      "ain't any Shepherdson about him.\"  Then the old man said he hoped I\n",
      "wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by\n",
      "it--it was only to make sure.  So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only\n",
      "felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to\n",

      "run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\n",

      "\n",
      "I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\n",

      "style.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\n",
      "with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\n",
      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",
      "pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\n",
      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\n",
      "and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money for\n",
      "her.\n",

      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\n",

      "parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\n",
      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",
      "behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",
      "pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\n",
      "was, underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \"Signing the\n",
      "Declaration.\" There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\"  These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\n",
      "Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\n",
      "It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\n",

      "then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was\n",
      "Whistler.  She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,\n",

      "out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\n",
      "aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that\n",
      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",
      "us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\n",
      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",
      "myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline's\n",

      "COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\n",
      "you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\n",
      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",

      "round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\n",

      "the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We never\n",
      "stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with\n",
      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\n",
      "_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't\n",

      "Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about\n",
      "brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\n",
      "a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\n",
      "a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\n",

      "and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\n",
      "not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her\n",

      "and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\n",
      "nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\n",

      "for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\n",

      "mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\n",

      "\n",
      "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\n",
      "I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out\n",
      "of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\n",
      "a-running, and says:\n",

      "\n",
      "I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\n",
      "ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece\n",

      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put\n",
      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",
      "laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\n",

      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\n",

      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he\n",

      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",
      "streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\n",
      "nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",

      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\n",
      "up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\n",

      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\n",
      "they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\n",

      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\n",
      "further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\n",

      "in the cottonwoods and was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\n",

      "into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had\n",

      "ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \"Your Grace,\" or \"My Lord,\"\n",
      "or \"Your Lordship\"--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain\n",
      "\"Bridgewater,\" which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\n",
      "one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for\n",
      "him he wanted done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood\n",
      "around and waited on him, and says, \"Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or\n",
      "some o' dat?\" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn't have much to say, and\n",
      "didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on\n",

      "in the afternoon, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Looky here, Bilgewater,\" he says, \"I'm nation sorry for you, but you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.\"  And,\n",
      "by jings, _he_ begins to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold!  What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the bitter death!\"  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\n",
      "and says, \"That secret of your being:  speak!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:\n",

      "\"You are what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must\n",

      "trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to\n",
      "do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.\n",
      " So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\n",
      "_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done\n",
      "with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\n",
      "easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\n",
      "rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down\n",
      "in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,\n",
      "and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he\n",
      "told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he\n",
      "got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and\n",
      "didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\n",
      "the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's\n",
      "great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\n",
      "deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\n",
      "considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the\n",
      "king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\n",
      "raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?  It 'll only\n",
      "make things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,\n",
      "it ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry?\n",
      " Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.\n",

      "\n",
      "The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took\n",
      "away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because\n",
      "it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the\n",

      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no\n",
      "kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I\n",
      "never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;\n",
      "then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.  If they\n",
      "wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as\n",
      "it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so\n",
      "I didn't tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt\n",

      "THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\n",
      "covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of\n",
      "running--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\n",
      "they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed\n",
      "he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\n",
      "one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was\n",
      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\n",
      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\n",
      "skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\n",
      "a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't\n",
      "bother us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\n",
      "want to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.\n",
      "We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by\n",
      "that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\n",
      "lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\n",
      "beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\n",
      "which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\n",
      "tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\n",
      "shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\n",
      "makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would\n",
      "take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\n",

      "take the shuck bed yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\n",
      "going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\n",
      "the duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\n",
      "oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\n",

      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand\n",
      "well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\n",
      "got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of\n",
      "lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half\n",
      "a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\n",
      "that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\n",
      "that and miss them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\n",
      "so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\n",
      "mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king\n",
      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\n",
      "me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\n",
      "regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.\n",
      " He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\n",
      "the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\n",
      "I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\n",
      "and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got\n",
      "tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they called\n",
      "it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of\n",
      "little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, \"The\n",
      "celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\" would \"lecture on the\n",
      "Science of Phrenology\" at such and such a place, on the blank day of\n",
      "blank, at ten cents admission, and \"furnish charts of character at\n",
      "twenty-five cents apiece.\"  The duke said that was _him_.  In another\n",
      "bill he was the \"world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the\n",
      "Younger, of Drury Lane, London.\"  In other bills he had a lot of other\n",
      "names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with\n",
      "a \"divining-rod,\" \"dissipating witch spells,\" and so on.  By and by he\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,\n",
      "Royalty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" says the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\" says\n",
      "the duke.  \"The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the\n",

      "How does that strike you?\"\n",

      "\"I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you\n",
      "see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much\n",
      "of it.  I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace.  Do you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Easy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right.  I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway.  Le's\n",
      "commence right away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\n",
      "said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white\n",
      "whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.\n",
      "Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the\n",
      "difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\n",
      "before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled\n",
      "nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\n",
      "meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white\n",
      "cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was\n",
      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",
      "king and told him to get his part by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\n",
      "in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\n",
      "go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,\n",
      "too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, so\n",
      "Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",
      "perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning\n",
      "himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or\n",
      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\n",
      "woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that\n",
      "camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;\n",
      "a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\n",
      "printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,\n",
      "littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed\n",
      "his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for\n",
      "the camp-meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\n",
      "awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\n",
      "watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",
      "shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\n",
      "was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\n",
      "it and live!\"  And people would shout out, \"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\"  And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\n",
      "soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\n",
      "heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\n",
      "is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\"\n",
      "(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\n",
      "account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the\n",
      "crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\n",
      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\n",
      "shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\n",

      "heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and\n",
      "the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,\n",

      "blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\n",
      "and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\n",

      "minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn't\n",
      "do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\n",
      "in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\n",

      "could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street\n",

      "jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\n",
      "a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\n",
      "\"O Lord, don't shoot!\"  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\n",
      "clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\n",
      "on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young\n",
      "girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her\n",

      "the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\n",
      "place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They\n",
      "laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened\n",
      "another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\n",
      "first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a\n",
      "dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his\n",
      "breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that\n",
      "he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from\n",

      "very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\n",
      "pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\n",
      "that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was\n",
      "saying all the time, \"Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;\n",

      "There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\n",

      "excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\n",
      "and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\n",

      "one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their\n",
      "heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\n",
      "hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\n",
      "his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had\n",
      "stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung\n",
      "out, \"Boggs!\" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says\n",
      "\"Bang!\" staggered backwards, says \"Bang!\" again, and fell down flat on\n",
      "his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;\n",
      "said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a\n",
      "dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a\n",

      "to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the\n",
      "mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\n",
      "the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every\n",
      "tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the\n",
      "mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of\n",

      "most to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could\n",
      "jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.  It\n",
      "was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out \"Tear down the fence! tear\n",
      "down the fence!\"  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\n",
      "smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to\n",

      "\n",
      "Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,\n",
      "with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly\n",

      "\n",
      "Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The\n",

      "along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to\n",
      "out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked\n",
      "sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant\n",
      "kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread\n",
      "that's got sand in it.\n",

      "The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing\n",

      "\n",
      "I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\n",
      "went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold\n",

      "nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and\n",
      "comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a\n",
      "lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang\n",
      "of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of\n",
      "dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;\n",
      "I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up\n",
      "and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and\n",
      "graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\n",
      "heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and\n",
      "every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,\n",

      "more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking\n",
      "his whip and shouting \"Hi!--hi!\" and the clown cracking jokes behind\n",
      "him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her\n",
      "knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how\n",
      "the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the\n",
      "other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and\n",

      "as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\n",
      "_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I\n",
      "couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.\n",
      "And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to\n",
      "ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued\n",
      "and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show\n",
      "come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him\n",
      "out!\" and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster\n",
      "he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no\n",
      "disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more\n",
      "trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\n",
      " So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\n",
      "he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\n",
      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\n",
      "till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\n",
      "could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\n",
      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\n",
      " But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\n",
      "clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\n",

      "to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't\n",

      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",

      "the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit no\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\n",
      "got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\n",

      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\n",

      "\n",

      "I see.\n",

      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\n",

      "every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke\n",
      "he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\n",
      "\"_Obsequies_, you old fool,\" and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and\n",
      "reaching it over people's heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts\n",

      "WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off\n",
      "for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for\n",
      "Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was\n",

      "of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room\n",
      "with.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for\n",
      "these fixings, and so don't disturb them.  The duke's room was pretty\n",

      "I'll hive that money for them or bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When\n",
      "I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,\n",
      "shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that\n",
      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to\n",
      "fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\n",
      "I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal that\n",
      "money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\n",
      "that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\n",
      "to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\n",
      "worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\n",
      "by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\n",
      "Mary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,\n",
      "because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he\n",
      "might scare them out of here yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was\n",
      "dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\n",
      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\n",
      "his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'd\n",
      "got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time\n",
      "I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\n",
      "reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\n",
      "the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\n",
      "snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\n",
      "get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\n",
      "when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\n",
      "the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and\n",
      "the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\n",
      "us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a\n",
      "chance to talk us over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable.  That\n",

      "notion, and I think it's a sound one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, duke?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\n",

      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--\" The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\n",
      "about?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\n",
      "duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "powerful astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it beats _me_\"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\n",
      "write them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here's _this_ old\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\n",
      "all.  Now, here's some letters from--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother\n",
      "there--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Well_!\" says the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\n",
      "can com--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He _can't_ write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman.  \"If he\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\n",
      "and mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",
      "Wilkses\"--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\n",
      " _now_ what do you say--hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We didn't see no such mark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" says the old gentleman.  \"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W\"--and he marked\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  \"Come, ain't that what you saw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there\n",
      "was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\n",
      "_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That took them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\n",
      "_them_ along, too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll do it!\" they all shouted; \"and if we don't find them marks we'll\n",

      "\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\n",
      "town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\n",

      "blow on our dead-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\n",
      "wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\n",
      "lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\n",
      "the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\n",
      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\n",
      "world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they\n",
      "didn't find them--\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\n",
      "about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\n",
      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\n",
      "like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the\n",

      "slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\n",
      "tell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two\n",
      "things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\n",
      "for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;\n",
      "and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\n",
      "and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and\n",
      "disgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck\n",
      "Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\n",
      "anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots\n",
      "for shame.  That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and\n",
      "then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he\n",
      "can hide it, it ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I\n",
      "studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the\n",
      "more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when\n",
      "it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence\n",
      "slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being\n",
      "watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a\n",
      "poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was\n",
      "showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going\n",
      "to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,\n",
      "I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I\n",
      "could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung\n",
      "up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me\n",
      "kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and\n",
      "if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as\n",
      "I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\n",
      "couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So\n",
      "I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  It\n",
      "warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I\n",
      "knowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn't\n",
      "right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing\n",
      "double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\n",
      "holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth\n",
      "_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write\n",
      "to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\n",
      "knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I found\n",
      "that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and\n",
      "then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\n",
      "light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I\n",
      "got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\n",
      "and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\n",
      "Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\n",
      "reward if you send.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Huck Finn._\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\n",
      "felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it\n",
      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\n",
      "and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our\n",
      "trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day\n",
      "and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\n",
      "a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\n",
      "other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\n",
      "calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\n",
      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",
      "says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\n",
      "performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?\"  Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Sold_ him?\"  I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--\" and then he stopped.  You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\n",

      "plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church\n",

      "this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\n",
      "before everybody.  I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all.  It was\n",

      "himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\n",

      "\"That's more _like_,\" he says.  \"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",

      " There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",

      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\n",

      "\"Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",

      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",

      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",

      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.\"\n",

      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",

      "IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down\n",
      "into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how\n",
      "to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;\n",
      "what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called\n",
      "fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a\n",
      "dark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down\n",
      "to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.\n",
      "And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\n",
      " There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a\n",
      "watchman.  There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And\n",
      "there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his\n",
      "bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off\n",
      "the chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the\n",
      "punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim\n",
      "could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be\n",
      "no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,\n",
      "Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_\n",
      "the difficulties.  Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can\n",
      "with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more\n",
      "honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,\n",
      "where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was\n",
      "their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your\n",
      "own head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you\n",
      "come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's\n",
      "resky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,\n",
      "I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to\n",
      "make a saw out of the first chance we get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do we want of a saw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do we _want_ of it?  Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed\n",
      "off, so as to get the chain loose?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up the\n",
      "infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain't you ever read\n",
      "any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,\n",
      "nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a\n",
      "prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the\n",
      "best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just\n",
      "so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and\n",
      "grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see\n",
      "no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.\n",
      "Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip\n",
      "off your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your\n",
      "rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the\n",
      "moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and\n",
      "there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and\n",
      "fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or\n",
      "Navarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat\n",
      "to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under\n",
      "the cabin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had\n",
      "his chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his\n",
      "head; then sighs again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For what?\"  I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, to saw Jim's leg off,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good land!\"  I says; \"why, there ain't _no_ necessity for it.  And what\n",
      "would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn't get the\n",
      "chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would\n",
      "be better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain't necessity\n",
      "enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't\n",
      "understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so\n",
      "we'll let it go.  But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we\n",
      "can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we\n",
      "can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way.  And I've et\n",
      "worse pies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\" I says; \"Jim ain't got no use for a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don't\n",
      "know nothing about it.  He's _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the nation can he _do_ with it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he?\"  That's what they\n",
      "all do; and _he's_ got to, too.  Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do\n",
      "anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the\n",
      "time. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,\n",
      "for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?\n",
      " Of course they will.  And you wouldn't leave them any?  That would be a\n",
      "_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn't_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have\n",
      "it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no\n",
      "regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up\n",
      "our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble\n",
      "with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born.  Now, the way I look at\n",
      "it, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing,\n",
      "and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,\n",
      "as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no\n",
      "experience, and so he don't care what kind of a--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep\n",
      "still--that's what I'D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping\n",
      "by a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my\n",
      "advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?\"\n",

      "\"Journal your granny--_Jim_ can't write.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"S'pose he _can't_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better\n",

      "\n",
      "\"_Prisoners_ don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull\n",
      "pens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of the\n",
      "hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or\n",
      "something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks\n",
      "and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've got\n",
      "to do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn't use a goose-quill\n",
      "if they had it. It ain't regular.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort\n",
      "and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;\n",
      "and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message\n",
      "to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the\n",
      "bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The\n",

      "writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Well, spos'n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we\n",
      "cleared out for the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the\n",
      "clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went\n",
      "down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,\n",
      "because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't\n",
      "borrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and\n",
      "prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody\n",
      "don't blame them for it, either.  It ain't no crime in a prisoner to\n",
      "steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and\n",
      "so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to\n",
      "steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves\n",
      "out of prison with.  He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very\n",
      "different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when\n",
      "he warn't a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was\n",
      "that come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,\n",
      "when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he\n",
      "made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it\n",
      "was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we\n",
      "_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn't\n",
      "need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.\n",
      " He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim\n",
      "to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at\n",
      "that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner\n",
      "if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like\n",
      "that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled\n",
      "down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he\n",
      "carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep\n",
      "watch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile\n",
      "to talk.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a\n",
      "nigger out with?\"  I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,\n",
      "and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?\n",
      " Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what\n",
      "kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as\n",
      "well lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they\n",
      "wouldn't furnish 'em to a king.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I says, \"if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do\n",
      "we want?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the _right_ way--and\n",
      "it's the regular way.  And there ain't no _other_ way, that ever I heard\n",
      "of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these\n",
      "things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind\n",
      "you; generly it's through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks\n",
      "and weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in\n",
      "the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that\n",
      "dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim\n",
      "don't, either, I reckon.  But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes he will _last_, too.  You don't reckon it's going to take\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How long will it take, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't\n",
      "take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\n",
      " He'll hear Jim ain't from there.  Then his next move will be to\n",
      "advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can't resk being as long\n",
      "digging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be\n",
      "a couple of years; but we can't.  Things being so uncertain, what I\n",
      "recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\n",
      "and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\n",
      "thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the\n",
      "first time there's an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, there's _sense_ in that,\" I says.  \"Letting on don't cost nothing;\n",
      "letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind\n",
      "letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn't strain\n",
      "me none, after I got my hand in.  So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a\n",
      "couple of case-knives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Smouch three,\" he says; \"we want one to make a saw out of.\"\n",

      "\"there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the\n",

      "AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\n",
      "pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the\n",
      "way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom\n",
      "said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and\n",
      "when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there\n",
      "was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the\n",
      "ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\n",
      " So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\n",
      "we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see\n",
      "we'd done anything hardly.  At last I says:\n",

      "they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and\n",
      "we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\n",

      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",

      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",

      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",

      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",

      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",

      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\n",

      "mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\n",
      "us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",

      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\n",
      "blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course\n",
      "we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\n",
      "in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\n",

      "lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\n",
      "handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\n",

      "IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and\n",
      "fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour\n",
      "we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put\n",
      "it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone for\n",
      "spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found\n",
      "it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,\n",

      "a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what\n",
      "they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted\n",

      "another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't\n",
      "the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\n",
      " I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\n",
      "caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's\n",
      "nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it right\n",
      "up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd\n",
      "tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we\n",
      "got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right\n",
      "again, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,\n",
      "and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\n",
      "a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\n",

      "generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\n",
      "of the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and\n",
      "striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never\n",
      "made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\n",

      "every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference\n",

      "never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You\n",

      "she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\n",
      "howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old\n",
      "man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes\n",

      "near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\n",

      "right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all\n",

      "because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\n",
      "had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other\n",
      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\n",
      "all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",
      "mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes\n",
      "and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\n",
      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",
      "always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\n",
      "took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\n",
      "when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\n",
      "gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\n",
      "and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\n",

      "the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\n",

      "\n",
      "But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was\n",

      "a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\n",
      "runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\n",

      "New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\n",
      "the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\n",
      "for the nonnamous letters.\n",

      "\n",

      "gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going\n",
      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted\n",
      "from the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They're so confiding\n",

      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\n",

      "\"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just\n",

      "not. Hain't you got no principle at all?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\n",

      "gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a\n",
      "prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called\n",
      "so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son;\n",
      "it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\n",

      "\n",
      "So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's\n",

      "warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be\n",
      "satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\n",
      "time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \"ouch,\" and\n",
      "before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it\n",
      "again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the\n",

      "more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the\n",

      "better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\n",
      "to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\n",

      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\n",

      "to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\n",
      "tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\n",

      " He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\n",
      "wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\n",

      "fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse\n",
      "full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\n",
      "him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about\n",
      "midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\n",
      "shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and\n",
      "not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to\n",
      "come home this evening and surprise the folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is your folks?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he says.  And after a minute, he says:\n",

      "\n",
      "So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But\n",
      "when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big\n",
      "enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\n",

      "\"Oh,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\n",
      "and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was\n",
      "all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\n",
      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But\n",
      "I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\n",
      "started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\n",

      "spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay\n",
      "around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what\n",
      "_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to\n",
      "go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\n",
      "him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\n",
      "with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him\n",
      "get ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\n",

      "or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\n",
      "for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,\n",

      "crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\n",
      "up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\n",
      "and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\n",
      "paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see\n",
      "what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for\n",

      "\n",
      "So then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\n",
      "suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\n",

      "said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done\n",

      "to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It\n",

      "of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,\n",
      "because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet\n",
      "never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick\n",

      "on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\n",
      "up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\n",
      "about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\n",
      "flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\n",
      "towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\n",

      "Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\n",

      "and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he\n",

      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\n",
      "I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as\n",
      "soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of\n",

      "pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and\n",
      "laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\n",
      "in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and\n",
      "set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\n",
      "now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\n",

      "\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying\n",
      "on the rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\n",
      "dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty\n",
      "things, and other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an\n",
      "injured sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got Father and Mother, and each other,\" said Beth contentedly\n",
      "from her corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\n",
      "cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \"We haven't got\n",
      "Father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She didn't say\n",
      "\"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far\n",
      "away, where the fighting was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, \"You know\n",
      "the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was\n",
      "because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we\n",
      "ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in\n",
      "the army.  We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\n",
      "ought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her\n",
      "head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've\n",
      "each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\n",
      "that.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\n",
      "to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,\" said\n",
      "Jo, who was a bookworm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\n",
      "which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need\n",
      "them,\" said Amy decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\n",
      "give up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little\n",
      "fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\n",
      "heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm\n",
      "longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\n",
      "like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\n",
      "you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\n",
      "fly out the window or cry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\n",
      "tidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\n",
      "get so stiff, I can't practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\n",
      "rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don't\n",
      "have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\n",
      "don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\n",
      "father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\n",
      "was a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's\n",
      "proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\n",
      "with dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money\n",
      "Papa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd\n",
      "be, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\n",
      "King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\n",
      "spite of their money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\n",
      "we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\n",
      "the long figure stretched on the rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\n",
      "whistle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's why I do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\n",
      "such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\n",
      "\"pecking\" ended for that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\n",
      "lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\n",
      "boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so\n",
      "much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\n",
      "your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\n",
      "tails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\n",
      "a chestnut mane.  \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\n",
      "March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It's\n",
      "bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and\n",
      "manners!  I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And\n",
      "it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And\n",
      "I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like\n",
      "castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Jo!  It's too bad, but it can't be helped.  So you must try to be\n",
      "contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\n",
      "girls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the\n",
      "dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its\n",
      "touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular\n",
      "and prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected\n",
      "little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and\n",
      "refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant.  But your\n",
      "absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\n",
      "ready to share the lecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly, and no one\n",
      "contradicted her, for the 'Mouse' was the pet of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take this\n",
      "moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\n",
      "knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\n",
      "without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable\n",
      "room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a\n",
      "good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\n",
      "chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\n",
      "pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\n",
      "plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet\n",
      "mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\n",
      "Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she\n",
      "never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\n",
      "much in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\n",
      "gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\n",
      "funny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it\n",
      "was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders\n",
      "had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the\n",
      "uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\n",
      "woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,\n",
      "was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\n",
      "manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom\n",
      "disturbed.  Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the\n",
      "name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of\n",
      "her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.\n",
      "Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own\n",
      "opinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow\n",
      "hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying\n",
      "herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters\n",
      "of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\n",
      "of slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a\n",
      "good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone\n",
      "brightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the\n",
      "lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot\n",
      "how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, \"I'm the man\n",
      "of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for\n",
      "he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth, \"let's each get her something\n",
      "for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's like you, dear!  What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the\n",
      "idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\n",
      "her a nice pair of gloves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won't cost\n",
      "much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\n",
      "Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair\n",
      "with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\n",
      "presents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\n",
      "dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\"\n",
      "said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then\n",
      "surprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so\n",
      "much to do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up\n",
      "and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mean to act any more after this time.  I'm getting too old for\n",
      "such things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\n",
      "'dressing-up' frolics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\n",
      "with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\n",
      "actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\n",
      "boards,\" said Jo.  \"We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and\n",
      "do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make\n",
      "myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down\n",
      "easily, I'll drop.  If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\n",
      "graceful.  I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\"\n",
      "returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen\n",
      "because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain\n",
      "of the piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\n",
      "crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'\" and away went Jo,\n",
      "with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and\n",
      "jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \"Ow!\" was\n",
      "more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.\n",
      "Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let\n",
      "her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \"It's no use!  Do\n",
      "the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't\n",
      "blame me.  Come on, Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech\n",
      "of two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an\n",
      "awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird\n",
      "effect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in\n",
      "agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \"Ha! Ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\n",
      "rubbed his elbows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.\n",
      "You're a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that\n",
      "her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly.  \"I do think _The Witches Curse, an\n",
      "Operatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try\n",
      "_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do\n",
      "the killing part.  'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\" muttered\n",
      "Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous\n",
      "tragedian do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the\n",
      "bread.  Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\n",
      "general burst of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\n",
      "and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a\n",
      "'can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\n",
      "elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\n",
      "gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\n",
      "the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,\n",
      "getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to\n",
      "dinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look\n",
      "tired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things\n",
      "off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy\n",
      "to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The\n",
      "girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own\n",
      "way.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,\n",
      "dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth\n",
      "trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy\n",
      "gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\n",
      "happy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth\n",
      "clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up\n",
      "her napkin, crying, \"A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through\n",
      "the cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving\n",
      "wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry and get done!  Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper\n",
      "over your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her\n",
      "bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\n",
      "over the delight to come, till the others were ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too\n",
      "old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\n",
      "warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its name?  Or a\n",
      "nurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\n",
      "bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\n",
      "her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his\n",
      "work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\n",
      "minute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her\n",
      "feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\n",
      "the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\n",
      "should happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those\n",
      "hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent\n",
      "home.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the\n",
      "dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,\n",
      "hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and\n",
      "military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow\n",
      "with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them\n",
      "by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their\n",
      "affection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see\n",
      "them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these\n",
      "hard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to\n",
      "them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty\n",
      "faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves\n",
      "so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and\n",
      "prouder than ever of my little women.\" Everybody sniffed when they came\n",
      "to that part.  Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the\n",
      "end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she\n",
      "hid her face on her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, \"I am a selfish\n",
      "girl!  But I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in\n",
      "me by-and-by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We all will,\" cried Meg.  \"I think too much of my looks and hate to\n",
      "work, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman' and not be\n",
      "rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\n",
      "else,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\n",
      "harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and\n",
      "began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\n",
      "lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\n",
      "that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\n",
      "coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\n",
      "cheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress\n",
      "when you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have\n",
      "me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and\n",
      "sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from\n",
      "the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,\n",
      "where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\n",
      "Celestial City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\n",
      "passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\"\n",
      "said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\n",
      "and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\n",
      "top.  If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\n",
      "over again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\n",
      "at the mature age of twelve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\n",
      "playing all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our\n",
      "road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\n",
      "guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\n",
      "which is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\n",
      "begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can\n",
      "get before Father comes home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\n",
      "literal young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather\n",
      "think she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\n",
      "pianos, and being afraid of people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but\n",
      "nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully.  \"It is only another name for\n",
      "trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to\n",
      "be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled\n",
      "us out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of\n",
      "directions, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo,\n",
      "delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull\n",
      "task of doing her duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your\n",

      "\n",
      "They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then\n",
      "out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the\n",
      "girls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but\n",
      "tonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long\n",
      "seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,\n",
      "and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they\n",
      "talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through\n",
      "them.\n",

      "At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.\n",
      "No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had\n",
      "a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant\n",
      "accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a\n",
      "flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a\n",
      "cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\n",
      "coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the\n",
      "most pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could\n",

      "\n",
      "    Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\n",

      "The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the\n",
      "house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same\n",

      "Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\n",
      "stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\n",
      "disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down\n",
      "because it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her\n",
      "mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a\n",
      "little crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that\n",
      "beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it\n",
      "was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke\n",
      "Meg with a \"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her\n",
      "pillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,\n",
      "and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present\n",
      "very precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage\n",
      "and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and\n",
      "all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy\n",
      "with the coming day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\n",
      "which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved\n",
      "her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently\n",
      "given.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her\n",
      "to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"Mother wants\n",
      "us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.\n",
      "We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all\n",
      "this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can\n",
      "do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a\n",
      "little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good\n",
      "and help me through the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round\n",
      "her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\n",
      "so seldom seen on her restless face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let's do as they do.  I'll help you with\n",
      "the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\n",
      "whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her\n",
      "sisters' example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still\n",
      "while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\n",
      "touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\n",
      "their gifts, half an hour later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma\n",
      "went straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman\n",
      "for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah,\n",
      "who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by\n",
      "them all more as a friend than a servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything\n",
      "ready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\n",
      "basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper\n",
      "time.  \"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the\n",
      "little flask did not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\n",
      "it, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take\n",
      "the first stiffness off the new army slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?  Hannah washed and ironed\n",
      "them for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\n",
      "at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless the child!  She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\n",
      "March'.  How funny!\" cried Jo, taking one up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\n",
      "initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,\"\n",
      "said Beth, looking troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for\n",
      "no one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,\"\n",
      "said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed\n",
      "and steps sounded in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\n",
      "all waiting for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\n",
      "surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\n",
      "early.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't laugh at me, Jo!  I didn't mean anyone should know till the time\n",
      "came.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I\n",
      "gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\n",
      "one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\n",
      "herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her 'a\n",
      "trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\n",
      "ornament the stately bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\n",
      "being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\n",
      "minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\n",
      "girls to the table, eager for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We\n",
      "read some, and mean to every day,\" they all cried in chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I'm glad you began at once, and\n",
      "hope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.\n",
      "Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.\n",
      "Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they\n",
      "have no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy\n",
      "came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will\n",
      "you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\n",
      "minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, \"I'm\n",
      "so glad you came before we began!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\n",
      "Beth eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall take the cream and the muffings,\" added Amy, heroically giving\n",
      "up the article she most liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\n",
      "big plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\n",
      "shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\n",
      "milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was\n",
      "early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\n",
      "no one laughed at the queer party.\n",
      "\n",
      "A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\n",
      "ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\n",
      "hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\n",
      "crying for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them to laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\n",
      "there.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\n",
      "broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the\n",
      "mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while\n",
      "she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The\n",
      "girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\n",
      "fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to\n",
      "understand the funny broken English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Das ist gut!\"  \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things as they ate\n",
      "and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had\n",
      "never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,\n",
      "especially Jo, who had been considered a 'Sancho' ever since she was\n",
      "born.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of\n",
      "it.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there\n",
      "were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little\n",
      "girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with\n",
      "bread and milk on Christmas morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\n",
      "Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs\n",
      "collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\n",
      "the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white\n",
      "chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\n",
      "quite an elegant air to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for\n",
      "Marmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to\n",
      "the seat of honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\n",
      "escort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,\n",
      "and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the\n",
      "little notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a\n",
      "new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\n",
      "cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\n",
      "pronounced a perfect fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\n",
      "simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at\n",
      "the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\n",
      "the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being\n",
      "still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to\n",
      "afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\n",
      "wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made\n",
      "whatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,\n",
      "pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats\n",
      "covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering\n",
      "with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the\n",
      "same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of\n",
      "preserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many\n",
      "innocent revels.\n",
      "\n",
      "No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's\n",
      "content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots\n",
      "given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,\n",
      "an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\n",
      "picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The\n",
      "smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\n",
      "to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit\n",
      "for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\n",
      "whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage\n",
      "besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless\n",
      "amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been\n",
      "idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the\n",
      "dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\n",
      "most flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling\n",
      "and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an\n",
      "occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\n",
      "excitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\n",
      "apart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one playbill, was represented by a\n",
      "few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\n",
      "distance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus\n",
      "for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black\n",
      "pot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the\n",
      "glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\n",
      "from the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was\n",
      "allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,\n",
      "stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black\n",
      "beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in\n",
      "much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,\n",
      "singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing\n",
      "resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's\n",
      "voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were\n",
      "very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for\n",
      "breath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he\n",
      "stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,\n",
      "\"What ho, minion! I need thee!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and\n",
      "black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo\n",
      "demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.\n",
      "Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call\n",
      "up the spirit who would bring the love philter.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Hither, hither, from thy home,\n",
      "    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n",
      "    Born of roses, fed on dew,\n",
      "    Charms and potions canst thou brew?\n",
      "    Bring me here, with elfin speed,\n",
      "    The fragrant philter which I need.\n",
      "    Make it sweet and swift and strong,\n",
      "    Spirit, answer now my song!\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\n",
      "appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\n",
      "hair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Hither I come,\n",
      "    From my airy home,\n",
      "    Afar in the silver moon.\n",
      "    Take the magic spell,\n",
      "    And use it well,\n",
      "    Or its power will vanish soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\n",
      "vanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a\n",
      "lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having\n",
      "croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a\n",
      "mocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\n",
      "boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had\n",
      "killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and\n",
      "intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain\n",
      "fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the\n",
      "merits of the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but\n",
      "when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been\n",
      "got up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower\n",
      "rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning\n",
      "in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and\n",
      "silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with\n",
      "plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of\n",
      "course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in\n",
      "melting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented\n",
      "to fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a\n",
      "rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara\n",
      "to descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on\n",
      "Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when \"Alas!\n",
      "Alas for Zara!\" she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the\n",
      "tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the\n",
      "unhappy lovers in the ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\n",
      "wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so!  I told\n",
      "you so!\"  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,\n",
      "rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't laugh!  Act as if it was all right!\" and, ordering Roderigo up,\n",
      "banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\n",
      "shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\n",
      "gentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She\n",
      "also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\n",
      "of the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led\n",
      "them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the\n",
      "speech he ought to have made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to\n",
      "free the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees\n",
      "him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little\n",
      "servant, \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I\n",
      "shall come anon.\"  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,\n",
      "and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.\n",
      "Ferdinando, the 'minion', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the\n",
      "cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty\n",
      "after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal\n",
      "of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him\n",
      "what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have\n",
      "thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair\n",
      "rather marred the effect of the villain's death.  He was called before\n",
      "the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose\n",
      "singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the\n",
      "performance put together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\n",
      "himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\n",
      "the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\n",
      "informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if\n",
      "he will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\n",
      "rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his\n",
      "lady love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\n",
      "wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and after a\n",
      "touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands\n",
      "her hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\n",
      "gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear\n",
      "away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter\n",
      "and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter\n",
      "informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair\n",
      "and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy.  The bag\n",
      "is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage\n",
      "till it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the\n",
      "stern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,\n",
      "and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's\n",
      "blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the\n",
      "cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and\n",
      "extinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\n",
      "the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\n",
      "with laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah\n",
      "appeared, with \"Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk\n",
      "down to supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,\n",
      "they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee\n",
      "to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was\n",
      "unheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,\n",
      "actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and\n",
      "distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great\n",
      "bouquets of hot house flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and\n",
      "then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother did it.\" And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray\n",
      "beard and white eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\n",
      "sudden inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All wrong.  Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing\n",
      "into his head?  We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\n",
      "odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.  He knew my father years ago,\n",
      "and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\n",
      "allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\n",
      "them a few trifles in honor of the day.  I could not refuse, and so you\n",
      "have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\n",
      "breakfast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did!  He's a capital fellow,\n",
      "and I wish we could get acquainted.  He looks as if he'd like to know\n",
      "us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him\n",
      "when we pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to\n",
      "melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\n",
      "asked one of the girls.  \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says\n",
      "he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps\n",
      "his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor,\n",
      "and makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he\n",
      "didn't come.  Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us\n",
      "girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\n",
      "fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,\n",
      "when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.  I mean to know him some day,\n",
      "for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I've no\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found\n",
      "her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped\n",
      "up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.\n",
      "This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a\n",
      "dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a\n",
      "pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle.  As Meg\n",
      "appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.  Jo shook the tears off her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our\n",
      "poplins, because we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo with her\n",
      "mouth full.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg.  \"Mother says I may when I'm\n",
      "eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\n",
      "Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\n",
      "Whatever shall I do?  The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The\n",
      "front is all right.  I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\n",
      "will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\n",
      "my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I\n",

      "about dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves are\n",

      "if you don't I should be so mortified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll stay still.  I don't care much for company dancing. It's no\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\n",

      "\n",
      "So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', look over her dress, and sing\n",
      "blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her\n",
      "story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\n",
      "\n",
      "On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\n",

      "all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'.  Simple as the\n",
      "toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\n",
      "and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the\n",
      "house.  Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to\n",
      "pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth from her perch on the bed.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\n",

      "\n",
      "She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?  I'm spoiled!  I can't go!  My hair,\n",

      "her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just my luck!  You shouldn't have asked me to do it.  I always spoil\n",

      "a mess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with\n",
      "tears of regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't spoiled.  Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends\n",

      "I've seen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Serves me right for trying to be fine.  I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\n",
      "cried Meg petulantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.  But it will soon grow out\n",
      "again,\" said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\n",
      "united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her\n",

      "silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.\n",
      "Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white\n",
      "chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light\n",
      "glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite\n",
      "easy and fine\".  Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt\n",
      "her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed\n",
      "stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,\n",
      "dear me, let us be elegant or die.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\n",
      "daintily down the walk.  \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at\n",
      "eleven when I send Hannah for you.\"  As the gate clashed behind them, a\n",
      "voice cried from a window...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls, girls!  Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding\n",
      "with a laugh as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\n",
      "were all running away from an earthquake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real\n",

      "Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\n",
      "right?  And does my hair look very bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\n",
      "the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I shall forget.  If you see me doing anything wrong, just\n",
      "remind me by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch\n",
      "and her head a hasty brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, winking isn't ladylike.  I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is\n",
      "wrong, and nod if you are all right.  Now hold your shoulder straight,\n",
      "and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to\n",
      "anyone.  It isn't the thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you learn all the proper ways?  I never can.  Isn't that music\n",
      "gay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to\n",
      "parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to\n",
      "them.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and\n",
      "handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie\n",
      "and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls\n",
      "or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the\n",
      "wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.  Half\n",
      "a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the\n",
      "room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the\n",
      "joys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows\n",
      "went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.  No one came to talk to\n",
      "her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.\n",
      "She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth\n",
      "would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing\n",
      "began.  Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so\n",
      "briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered\n",
      "smilingly.  Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and\n",
      "fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess,\n",
      "intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.  Unfortunately, another\n",
      "bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell\n",
      "behind her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\n",
      "back out as speedily as she had bounced in.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\n",
      "startled, \"Don't mind me, stay if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shan't I disturb you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit.  I only came here because I don't know many people and felt\n",
      "rather strange at first, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So did I.  Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\n",
      "be polite and easy, \"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "before.  You live near us, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Next door.\"  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim\n",
      "manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about\n",
      "cricket when he brought the cat home.\n",
      "\n",
      "That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her\n",
      "heartiest way, \"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas\n",
      "present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandpa sent it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober\n",
      "while his black eyes shone with fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.  But I am not Miss March, I'm only\n",
      "Jo,\" returned the young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I hate my name, too, so sentimental!  I wish every one would say Jo\n",
      "instead of Josephine.  How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thrashed 'em.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.\"  And\n",
      "Jo resigned herself with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\n",
      "thought the name suited her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is\n",
      "lively.  In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\n",
      "people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and\n",
      "let Meg sail about.  Don't you dance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes.  You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't\n",
      "been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Abroad!\" cried Jo.  \"Oh, tell me about it!  I love dearly to hear\n",
      "people describe their travels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions\n",
      "soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay,\n",
      "where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,\n",
      "and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their\n",
      "teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo.  \"Did you go to Paris?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We spent last winter there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you talk French?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do say some!  I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nicely you do it!  Let me see ... you said, 'Who is the young lady\n",
      "in the pretty slippers', didn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!  Do you think she is\n",
      "pretty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\n",
      "quiet, and dances like a lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\n",
      "stored it up to repeat to Meg.  Both peeped and criticized and chatted\n",
      "till they felt like old acquaintances.  Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\n",
      "off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\n",
      "Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody\n",
      "lifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than\n",
      "ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\n",
      "to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\n",
      "were almost unknown creatures to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine\n",
      "teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,\n",
      "and altogether jolly.  Wonder how old he is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in\n",
      "time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you are going to college soon?  I see you pegging away at\n",
      "your books, no, I mean studying hard.\"  And Jo blushed at the dreadful\n",
      "'pegging' which had escaped her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  \"Not\n",
      "for a year or two.  I won't go before seventeen, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\n",
      "had imagined seventeen already.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixteen, next month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How I wish I was going to college!  You don't look as if you liked it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate it!  Nothing but grinding or skylarking.  And I don't like the\n",
      "way fellows do either, in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows\n",
      "looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject\n",
      "by saying, as her foot kept time, \"That's a splendid polka!  Why don't\n",
      "you go and try it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, because...\" There Jo stopped, and\n",
      "looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because, what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't tell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\n",
      "frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it\n",
      "shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.  You may\n",
      "laugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Laurie didn't laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the\n",
      "expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, \"Never mind\n",
      "that.  I'll tell you how we can manage.  There's a long hall out there,\n",
      "and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when\n",
      "she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was\n",
      "empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught\n",
      "her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and\n",
      "spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get\n",
      "their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students'\n",
      "festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She\n",
      "beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she\n",
      "found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a\n",
      "sad wrench.  It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm\n",
      "ever going to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I'm sorry.  But I\n",
      "don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\n",
      "night,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say\n",
      "I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a\n",
      "long way to the stable, and no one to send.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!  It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can't stop here,\n",
      "for the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll\n",
      "rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll ask Laurie.  He will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\n",
      "occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy, no!  Don't ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put\n",
      "these slippers with our things.  I can't dance anymore, but as soon as\n",
      "supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are going out to supper now.  I'll stay with you.  I'd rather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I'm so tired I can't\n",
      "stir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\n",
      "to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,\n",
      "and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a\n",
      "little private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured\n",
      "the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of\n",
      "her dress as bad as the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's\n",
      "glove by scrubbing her gown with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice.  And there was Laurie, with a\n",
      "full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone\n",
      "shook me, and here I am in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\n",
      "dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it\n",
      "to your sister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you!  I'll show you where she is.  I don't offer to take it\n",
      "myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\n",
      "little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,\n",
      "and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a 'nice\n",
      "boy'.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in\n",
      "the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young\n",
      "people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot\n",
      "and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an\n",
      "exclamation of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's\n",
      "nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that's all,\" and limped upstairs\n",
      "to put her things on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\n",
      "decided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down\n",
      "and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\n",
      "happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood\n",
      "and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she\n",
      "said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\n",
      "come for him, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's so early!  You can't mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved\n",
      "but hesitating to accept the offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always go early, I do, truly!  Please let me take you home. It's all\n",
      "on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\n",
      "accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.  Hannah\n",
      "hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they\n",
      "rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\n",
      "elegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\n",
      "girls talked over their party in freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a capital time.  Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\n",
      "making herself comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy\n",
      "to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does.\n",
      "She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be\n",
      "perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\n",
      "up at the thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.  Was he\n",
      "nice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, very!  His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I\n",
      "had a delicious redowa with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie\n",
      "and I couldn't help laughing.  Did you hear us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but it was very rude.  What were you about all that time, hidden\n",
      "away there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at\n",
      "home.  With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to\n",
      "disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little\n",
      "nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell about the party!  Tell about the party!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some\n",
      "bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the\n",
      "most thrilling events of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\n",
      "from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to\n",
      "wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed\n",
      "her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\n",
      "do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight\n",

      "the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\n",
      "seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,\n",
      "and drive home, and read and rest, and not work.  It's like other\n",
      "people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so\n",
      "fond of luxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns\n",
      "was the least shabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our\n",
      "bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does.  I'm sure Aunt\n",
      "March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\n",
      "learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get\n",
      "so light that I shan't mind her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg\n",
      "didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children,\n",
      "seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself\n",
      "pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair\n",
      "in the most becoming way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\n",
      "midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\n",
      "shutting her drawer with a jerk.  \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\n",
      "days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\n",
      "and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\n",
      "It's a shame!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\n",

      "Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with\n",
      "the cat and three kittens.  Amy was fretting because her lessons were\n",

      "make a great racket getting ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at\n",

      "\"There never was such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper when\n",

      "her hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\n",

      "which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\n",

      "\n",
      "Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she\n",

      "pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\n",
      "always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\n",
      "Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\n",
      "that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\n",

      "bitter wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't use such dreadful expressions,\" replied Meg from the depths of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I like good strong words that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching\n",

      "altogether.\n",
      "\n",

      "envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl\n",

      "discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'\" (Here Jo\n",

      "that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!\n",
      "It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Never take advice!  Can't keep still all day, and not being a\n",

      "\n",
      "Meg went back to toast her feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig\n",
      "paths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she\n",
      "soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the\n",
      "sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden\n",
      "separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in\n",
      "a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and\n",
      "lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two\n",
      "estates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and\n",
      "shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the\n",
      "flowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately\n",
      "stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,\n",
      "from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and\n",
      "the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children\n",
      "frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and\n",
      "few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted\n",
      "palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had\n",
      "long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence\n",
      "boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\n",
      "begin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\n",
      "planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen\n",
      "lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied\n",
      "a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their\n",
      "garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His\n",
      "grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all\n",
      "alone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\n",

      "so!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always\n",

      "was not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to\n",
      "try what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then\n",
      "sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took\n",
      "a survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out\n",
      "of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a\n",
      "thin hand at the upper window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal\n",

      "then say a kind word to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\n",
      "face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\n",
      "brightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and\n",
      "flourished her broom as she called out...\n",

      "\"So I do!  Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go\n",

      "With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,\n",
      "wondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of\n",
      "excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,\n",
      "for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to\n",
      "the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color,\n",
      "and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen\n",
      "servants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,\n",
      "than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking\n",
      "servant came running up to announce a young lady.\n",
      "\n",

      "and was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring\n",
      "some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her\n",
      "cats would be comforting.  I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't\n",
      "refuse, she was so anxious to do something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in\n",
      "laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew\n",
      "sociable at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\n",
      "uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland\n",
      "of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.\n",
      "Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It's so simple you can eat\n",
      "it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\n",
      "What a cozy room this is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't\n",
      "know how to make them mind.  It worries me though.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth\n",
      "brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and\n",
      "the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from\n",
      "the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you're fixed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\n",
      "into place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched\n",
      "her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he\n",
      "sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are!  Yes, that's what it wanted.  Now please take the\n",
      "big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked\n",
      "affectionately toward some inviting books near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you!  I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\n",
      "talk,\" answered Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit.  I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\n",
      "never know when to stop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes\n",
      "out with a little basket?\" asked Laurie with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's Beth.  She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you find that out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see I often hear you\n",
      "calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help\n",
      "looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good\n",
      "times.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget\n",
      "to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when\n",
      "the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire,\n",
      "and you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right\n",
      "opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help\n",
      "watching it.  I haven't got any mother, you know.\" And Laurie poked the\n",
      "fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\n",
      "She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\n",
      "and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was\n",
      "sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,\n",
      "she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and\n",
      "her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look\n",
      "as much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd\n",
      "come over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of\n",
      "good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would\n",
      "dance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,\n",
      "and we'd have jolly times.  Wouldn't your grandpa let you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He's very kind, though he\n",
      "does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\n",
      "afraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening\n",
      "more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\n",
      "a bother.  We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\n",
      "so long.  We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\n",
      "acquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\n",
      "happens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know,\n",
      "and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get\n",
      "on as I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere\n",
      "you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places\n",
      "to go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won't last long if you keep\n",
      "going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\n",
      "bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible\n",
      "not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\n",
      "little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about\n",
      "her, well pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean.  I go to wait on\n",
      "my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just\n",
      "in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\n",
      "affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt\n",
      "March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,\n",
      "her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where\n",
      "she reveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old\n",
      "gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine\n",
      "speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy\n",
      "lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid\n",
      "popped her head in to see what was the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,\" he said, taking\n",
      "his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays\n",
      "and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting\n",
      "events of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got\n",
      "to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie\n",
      "loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,\n",
      "so you needn't be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\n",
      "admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to\n",
      "be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\n",
      "moods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way\n",
      "from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her\n",
      "fancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her\n",
      "hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was\n",
      "lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting\n",
      "little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow\n",
      "chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open\n",
      "fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair\n",
      "and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore\n",
      "Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\n",
      "impressively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fellow can't live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head as he\n",
      "perched on a table opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\n",
      "alarm, \"Mercy me!  It's your grandpa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\n",
      "returned the boy, looking wicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should\n",
      "be.  Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse\n",
      "for it,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\n",
      "afraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I\n",
      "couldn't bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,\"\n",
      "said Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't mind me.  I'm happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\n",
      "standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door\n",
      "opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, \"I'm sure now\n",
      "that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\n",
      "mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\n",
      "He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her\n",
      "great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\n",
      "to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a\n",
      "minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,\n",
      "and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out\n",
      "of the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living\n",
      "eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,\n",
      "and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good\n",
      "deal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said\n",
      "abruptly, after the dreadful pause, \"So you're not afraid of me, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only said I thought so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you like me in spite of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook\n",
      "hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\n",
      "face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, \"You've\n",
      "got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.  He was a fine\n",
      "man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\n",
      "I was proud to be his friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it\n",
      "suited her exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next\n",
      "question, sharply put.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir.\"  And Jo told how her visit came\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\n",
      "perhaps.  We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\n",
      "for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said\n",
      "Jo eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tut, tut, tut!  That was the boy's affair.  How is the poor woman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doing nicely, sir.\"  And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told\n",
      "all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends\n",
      "than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just her father's way of doing good.  I shall come and see your mother\n",
      "some fine day.  Tell her so.  There's the tea bell, we have it early on\n",
      "the boy's account.  Come down and go on being neighborly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'd like to have me, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.\"  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\n",
      "with old-fashioned courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\n",
      "while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the\n",
      "story at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old\n",
      "gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a\n",
      "start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his\n",
      "redoubtable grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you'd come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\n",
      "little glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,\n",
      "sir, and behave like a gentleman.\"  And having pulled the boy's hair by\n",
      "way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\n",
      "series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\n",
      "explosion of laughter from Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,\n",
      "but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old\n",
      "friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was\n",
      "color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner,\n",
      "and genuine merriment in his laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's right, the lad is lonely.  I'll see what these little girls can\n",
      "do for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked\n",
      "Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand\n",
      "the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not\n",
      "have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.\n",
      "But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\n",
      "impression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\n",
      "something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,\n",
      "which had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to\n",
      "Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on\n",
      "either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful\n",
      "vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the\n",
      "finest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,\n",
      "with the happy look Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother,\n",
      "and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing\n",
      "room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which\n",
      "stood open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you first?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\n",
      "heliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence'\n",
      "boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put\n",
      "on any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,\n",
      "only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to\n",
      "his rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not\n",
      "good for him.  His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in\n",
      "more important things.  Going?  well, I'm much obliged to you, and I\n",
      "hope you'll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor\n",
      "Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\n",
      "When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something\n",
      "amiss.  He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it was me.  He doesn't like to hear me play.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.  Take\n",
      "care of yourself, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, Laurie!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, Jo, good night!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt\n",
      "inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\n",
      "attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\n",
      "wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten\n",
      "him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand\n",
      "piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,\n",
      "who was of an inquiring disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\n",
      "married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\n",
      "is very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he\n",
      "did not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both\n",
      "died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him\n",
      "home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and\n",
      "the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.\n",
      "Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,\n",
      "and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.\n",
      "At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so\n",
      "he 'glowered' as Jo said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How silly!\" said Jo.  \"Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not\n",
      "plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\n",
      "suppose.  Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\n",
      "sentimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to\n",
      "him, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was not sentimental.\n",

      "\n",
      "The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time\n",
      "for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old\n",
      "Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said\n",
      "something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old\n",
      "times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid\n",
      "Beth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,\n",
      "for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.\n",
      "But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,\n",
      "and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\n",
      "motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\n",
      "that humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and\n",
      "interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new\n",
      "friendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,\n",
      "and he privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\n",
      "splendid girls.\"  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took\n",
      "the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found\n",
      "something very charming in the innocent companionship of these\n",
      "simple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was\n",
      "quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,\n",
      "lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired\n",
      "of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was\n",
      "obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always\n",
      "playing truant and running over to the Marches'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,\" said\n",
      "the old gentleman.  \"The good lady next door says he is studying too\n",
      "hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she\n",
      "is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\n",
      "grandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He\n",
      "can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.\n",
      "March is doing more for him than we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such\n",
      "sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\n",
      "parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.\n",
      "Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in\n",
      "bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed\n",
      "the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed\n",
      "beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 'lord of the manor' in\n",
      "the most delightful style.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\n",
      "courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.  She went\n",
      "once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,\n",
      "stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so\n",
      "loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet chattered on the floor',\n",
      "she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never\n",
      "go there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or\n",
      "enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.\n",
      "Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.\n",
      "During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation\n",
      "to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine\n",
      "organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found\n",
      "it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and\n",
      "nearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and\n",
      "stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with\n",
      "excitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her\n",
      "than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's\n",
      "lessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred\n",
      "to him, he said to Mrs. March...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\n",
      "too fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn't some\n",
      "of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just\n",
      "to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to\n",
      "keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and\n",
      "the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her\n",
      "breath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with\n",
      "an odd little nod and smile...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm\n",
      "shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a\n",
      "great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine\n",
      "o'clock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\n",
      "last arrangement left nothing to be desired.  \"Please, tell the young\n",
      "ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.\"\n",
      "Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\n",
      "face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as\n",
      "he looked down at her very kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm Beth.  I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure\n",
      "nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude,\n",
      "and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and\n",
      "drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was\n",
      "not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she\n",
      "had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The\n",
      "old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping\n",
      "down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my\n",
      "dear!  Good day, madam.\"  And away he went, in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\n",
      "glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.\n",
      "How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her\n",
      "because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\n",
      "her sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out\n",
      "of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\n",
      "side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing\n",
      "room where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,\n",
      "easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent\n",
      "stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\n",
      "instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\n",
      "else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\n",
      "like the voice of a beloved friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no\n",
      "appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state\n",
      "of beatitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly\n",
      "every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit\n",
      "that came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his\n",
      "study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw\n",
      "Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never\n",
      "suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the\n",
      "rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her\n",
      "about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things\n",
      "that helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,\n",
      "what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had\n",
      "hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing\n",
      "that a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so\n",
      "kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do\n",
      "it?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of\n",
      "thanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for\n",
      "the making up,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in\n",
      "granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\n",
      "the materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet\n",
      "cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very\n",
      "appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with\n",
      "occasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,\n",
      "and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote\n",
      "a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto\n",
      "the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.\n",
      "All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement\n",
      "arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety\n",
      "friend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\n",
      "errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As\n",
      "she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads\n",
      "popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\n",
      "several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Beth, he's sent you...\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly\n",
      "energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down\n",
      "the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters\n",
      "seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\n",
      "pointing and all saying at once, \"Look there!  Look there!\"  Beth did\n",
      "look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a\n",
      "little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed\n",
      "like a sign board to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should\n",
      "tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn't it splendid of him?  Don't you\n",
      "think he's the dearest old man in the world?  Here's the key in the\n",
      "letter.  We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You read it!  I can't, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!\" and\n",
      "Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\n",
      "were...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss March: \"Dear Madam--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!\" said Amy,\n",
      "who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any\n",
      "that suited me so well as yours,'\" continues Jo.  \"'Heart's-ease is my\n",
      "favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.\n",
      "I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow 'the old gentleman' to\n",
      "send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me\n",
      "how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept\n",
      "all her little things carefully.  Just think, he's given you her piano.\n",
      "That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying\n",
      "to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever\n",
      "been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\n",
      "puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\n",
      "stool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\n",
      "its beauties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'.  Only think of his writing that\n",
      "to you.  I'll tell the girls.  They'll think it's splendid,\" said Amy,\n",
      "much impressed by the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try it, honey.  Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,\" said Hannah,\n",
      "who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano\n",
      "ever heard.  It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\n",
      "order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the\n",
      "happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\n",
      "touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\n",
      "pedals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke, for the\n",

      "about it.\" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\n",
      "walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\n",
      "Laurences' door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see!  The\n",

      "cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\n",
      "speechless by the miracle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\n",
      "afterward.  If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study\n",
      "door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice\n",
      "called out, \"come in!\" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who\n",
      "looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\n",
      "small quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for...\" But she\n",
      "didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech\n",
      "and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she\n",
      "put both arms round his neck and kissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\n",
      "wouldn't have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he\n",
      "liked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding\n",
      "little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on\n",
      "his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as\n",
      "if he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to\n",
      "fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if\n",
      "she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude\n",
      "can conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own\n",
      "gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back\n",
      "again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\n",
      "gentleman, as he was.\n",

      "During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got\n",
      "twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to\n",
      "treat circulated through her 'set', and the attentions of her friends\n",
      "became quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on\n",
      "the spot.  Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess,\n",
      "and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon\n",
      "her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish\n",
      "answers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss\n",

      "the airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes\n",
      "before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with\n",
      "disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale\n",
      "compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking\n",
      "an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March\n",
      "had pickled limes in her desk.\n",

      "Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\n",

      "law.  This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum\n",
      "after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated\n",

      "forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done\n",
      "all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in\n",
      "order.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but\n",
      "girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with\n",
      "tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.\n",
      "Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of\n",
      "all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,\n",
      "feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular\n",
      "importance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and\n",
      "Jenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong\n",
      "that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his\n",
      "neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he\n",
      "deserved.  Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language\n",
      "of a schoolgirl, \"He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear\".\n",
      "The word 'limes' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and\n",

      "Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\n",
      "that delicious perfume met his nose.  Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\n",
      "particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\n",
      "added to his wrath.\n",

      "There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as\n",
      "the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\n",
      "Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,\n",
      "and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from\n",
      "her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of\n",
      "the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by\n",
      "the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.  This--this was\n",
      "too much.  All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\n",
      "Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"\n",
      "and said, in his most impressive manner...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.  I am sorry\n",

      "never break my word.  Miss March, hold out your hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\n",
      "look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\n",
      "She was rather a favorite with 'old Davis', as, of course, he was\n",
      "called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken his word\n",
      "if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent\n",
      "in a hiss.  That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible\n",
      "gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received,\n",
      "and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head\n",
      "defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\n",
      "little palm.  They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\n",
      "difference to her.  For the first time in her life she had been struck,\n",
      "and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\n",
      "resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was dreadful.  It would have been bad enough to go to her seat,\n",
      "and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her\n",
      "few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon\n",
      "her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only\n",
      "drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.  A bitter\n",
      "sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,\n",
      "and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove\n",
      "funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so\n",
      "motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that\n",
      "pathetic figure before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive\n",
      "little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.  To\n",
      "others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a\n",
      "hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been\n",
      "governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\n",
      "before.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\n",
      "in the sting of the thought, \"I shall have to tell at home, and they\n",
      "will be so disappointed in me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,\n",
      "and the word 'Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\n",
      "uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she\n",
      "went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched\n",
      "her things, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared\n",
      "to herself.  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the\n",
      "older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held\n",
      "at once.  Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and\n",
      "comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg\n",
      "bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even\n",
      "her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo\n",
      "wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and\n",
      "Hannah shook her fist at the 'villain' and pounded potatoes for dinner\n",
      "as if she had him under her pestle.\n",
      "\n",
      "No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but the\n",
      "sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\n",
      "the afternoon, also unusually nervous.  Just before school closed, Jo\n",
      "appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and\n",
      "delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy's property, and\n",
      "departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as\n",
      "if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\n",
      "little every day with Beth,\" said Mrs. March that evening. \"I don't\n",
      "approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.  I dislike Mr.\n",
      "Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls you associate with\n",
      "are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\n",
      "send you anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's good!  I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\n",
      "school.  It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\"\n",
      "sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\n",
      "some punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\n",
      "disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"\n",
      "cried Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\n",
      "mother, \"but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a bolder\n",
      "method.  You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is\n",
      "quite time you set about correcting it.  You have a good many little\n",
      "gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit\n",
      "spoils the finest genius.  There is not much danger that real talent or\n",
      "goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of\n",
      "possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of\n",
      "all power is modesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.\n",
      "\"I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and\n",
      "she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed\n",
      "when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if anyone had told\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I'd known that nice girl.  Maybe she would have helped me, I'm\n",
      "so stupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,\"\n",
      "answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\n",
      "merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\n",
      "in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\n",
      "could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\n",
      "Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly\n",
      "lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\n",
      "character.  When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,\n",
      "said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, \"Is Laurie an\n",
      "accomplished boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will\n",
      "make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,\" replied her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least.  That is why he is so charming and we all like him\n",
      "so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see.  It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to\n",
      "show off or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and\n",
      "conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display\n",
      "them,\" said Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\n",
      "ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,\" added Jo, and\n",

      "\"Girls, where are you going?\" asked Amy, coming into their room one\n",
      "Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an\n",
      "air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind.  Little girls shouldn't ask questions,\" returned Jo\n",
      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,\n",
      "it is to be told that, and to be bidden to \"run away, dear\" is still\n",
      "more trying to us.  Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to\n",
      "find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\n",
      "never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me!\n",
      "I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her\n",
      "piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so lonely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,\" began Meg, but Jo broke in\n",
      "impatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.  You can't\n",
      "go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.  You were\n",
      "whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you\n",
      "stopped when I came in.  Aren't you going with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we are.  Now do be still, and stop bothering.\"\n",

      "said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it was mean not to\n",
      "tell me in time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.\n",
      "\"Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not\n",
      "well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.  Next week you\n",
      "can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please\n",
      "let me.  I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying\n",
      "for some fun.  Do, Meg!  I'll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\n",
      "pathetic as she could.\n",

      "\"Suppose we take her.  I don't believe Mother would mind, if we bundle\n",

      "\"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and it\n",

      "should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted,\" said\n",

      "when she wanted to enjoy herself.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit\n",

      "reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\n",
      "hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she\n",
      "forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the\n",
      "party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening\n",
      "tone, \"You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "They had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_\n",

      "comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and\n",
      "princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy\n",
      "queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she\n",
      "amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\n",
      "'sorry for it'.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the\n",
      "course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be\n",
      "violent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\n",
      "semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\n",
      "afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\n",
      "hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually\n",
      "getting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having\n",
      "humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do\n",
      "better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a\n",
      "fury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried\n",
      "desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame\n",
      "up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\n",

      "asked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\n",
      "resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing\n",
      "description of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's\n",
      "first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had\n",
      "soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the\n",
      "floor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance\n",
      "into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\n",
      "forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced\n",

      "breathlessly, \"Has anyone taken my book?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg and Beth said, \"No.\" at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the\n",

      "the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we\n",
      "begin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a\n",
      "young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on\n",
      "her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and\n",
      "went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\n",
      "satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till\n",
      "it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\n",
      "feelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,\n",
      "he shouted back...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep near the shore.  It isn't safe in the middle.\" Jo heard, but Amy\n",

      "Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\n",
      "far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\n",
      "river.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her\n",
      "heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her\n",
      "round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a\n",
      "sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made\n",
      "Jo's heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her\n",
      "voice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have\n",
      "no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,\n",
      "staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the\n",
      "black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried\n",
      "out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked\n",
      "as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\n",
      "and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged\n",
      "a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\n",
      "frightened than hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on\n",
      "her, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping\n",
      "his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed\n",
      "so intricate before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an\n",
      "exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot\n",
      "fire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,\n",
      "looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and\n",
      "her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When\n",
      "Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by\n",
      "the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure she is safe?\" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the\n",
      "golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever\n",
      "under the treacherous ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,\n",
      "you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\" replied\n",
      "her mother cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it\n",
      "would be my fault.\"  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of\n",
      "penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\n",
      "hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\n",
      "heavy punishment which might have come upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then\n",

      "shall I do?\" cried poor Jo, in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is\n",
      "impossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\n",
      "head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\n",
      "cried even harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is!  It seems as if I could\n",
      "do anything when I'm in a passion.  I get so savage, I could hurt\n",
      "anyone and enjoy it.  I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some\n",
      "day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help\n",
      "me, do help me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, my child, I will.  Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this\n",
      "day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another\n",
      "like it.  Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than\n",
      "yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.  You think\n",
      "your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yours, Mother?  Why, you are never angry!\"  And for the moment Jo\n",
      "forgot remorse in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded\n",
      "in controlling it.  I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I\n",
      "have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,\n",
      "though it may take me another forty years to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a\n",
      "better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.  She\n",
      "felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her.  The\n",
      "knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,\n",
      "made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it,\n",
      "though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a\n",
      "girl of fifteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go\n",
      "out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?\"\n",
      "asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and\n",
      "when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away\n",
      "for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and\n",
      "wicked,\" answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed\n",
      "and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you learn to keep still?  That is what troubles me, for the\n",
      "sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more I say\n",
      "the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings and say\n",
      "dreadful things.  Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My good mother used to help me...\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\n",
      "had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\n",
      "anyone else.  I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\n",
      "over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.\n",
      "Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\n",
      "good.  But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we\n",
      "were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by\n",
      "nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Mother!  What helped you then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father, Jo.  He never loses patience, never doubts or complains,\n",
      "but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed\n",
      "to do otherwise before him.  He helped and comforted me, and showed me\n",
      "that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little\n",
      "girls possess, for I was their example.  It was easier to try for your\n",
      "sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you\n",
      "when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,\n",
      "and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest\n",
      "reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them\n",
      "copy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, much touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch\n",
      "over your 'bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\n",
      "spoil your life.  You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with\n",
      "heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you\n",
      "greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will try, Mother, I truly will.  But you must help me, remind me,\n",

      "finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,\n",
      "and you always folded your lips tight and went away.  Was he reminding\n",
      "you then?\" asked Jo softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\n",
      "from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she\n",
      "spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\n",
      "\"Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it?  I didn't mean to be\n",
      "rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\n",
      "safe and happy here.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I thought I'd grieved you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how\n",
      "much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\n",
      "little daughters safe and good for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\n",
      "gone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty\n",
      "and will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don't seem to\n",
      "need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to\n",
      "comfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your\n",
      "life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive\n",
      "them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your\n",
      "Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love\n",
      "and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will\n",
      "depend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or\n",
      "change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of\n",
      "lifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go\n",
      "to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as\n",
      "freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.\"\n",

      "Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which\n",
      "followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\n",
      "without words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not\n",
      "only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of\n",
      "self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she had\n",

      "\"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my\n",
      "adventures to tell you when I come back.  I'm sure it's the least I can\n",
      "do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get\n",
      "ready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\n",
      "which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?\" asked Amy, who had\n",
      "not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.\n",
      "March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\n",
      "the proper time came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\n",
      "sash.  I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over,\n",
      "so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\n",
      "off beautifully.  I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you\n",
      "might have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\n",
      "possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but\n",
      "Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\n",
      "and Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg.  \"Now, let me\n",
      "see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my\n",
      "hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks\n",
      "heavy for spring, doesn't it?  The violet silk would be so nice.  Oh,\n",
      "dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always\n",
      "look like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store\n",
      "of finery in which her soul delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to\n",
      "do.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\n",
      "I feel as if I'd got a new one.  My silk sacque isn't a bit the\n",
      "fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's.  I didn't like to\n",
      "say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told\n",
      "Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one\n",
      "with a yellowish handle.  It's strong and neat, so I ought not to\n",
      "complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one\n",
      "with a gold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\n",
      "disfavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Change it,\" advised Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much\n",
      "pains to get my things.  It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not\n",
      "going to give up to it.  My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\n",
      "are my comfort.  You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.  I feel so rich\n",
      "and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up\n",
      "for common.\"  And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put\n",
      "some on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\n",
      "fresh from Hannah's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without\n",
      "any trimming on them.  Poor folks shouldn't rig,\" said Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my\n",
      "clothes and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only\n",
      "go to Annie Moffat's,\" observed Beth in her quiet way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if\n",
      "the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?  There now, the trays\n",
      "are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for\n",
      "Mother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the\n",
      "half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,\n",
      "which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of\n",
      "novelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\n",
      "reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\n",
      "than she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take\n",
      "good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a\n",
      "winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\n",
      "to take her first taste of fashionable life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\n",
      "at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\n",
      "occupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\n",
      "they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\n",
      "without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated\n",
      "or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite\n",
      "conceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly\n",
      "was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her\n",
      "best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her\n",
      "exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\n",
      "those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\n",
      "crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as\n",
      "well as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things,\n",
      "the more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare\n",
      "and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she\n",
      "felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of\n",
      "the new gloves and silk stockings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\n",
      "were busily employed in 'having a good time'.  They shopped, walked,\n",
      "rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at\n",
      "home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to\n",
      "entertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\n",
      "was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\n",
      "Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and\n",
      "Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as\n",
      "her daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and 'Daisey', as they\n",
      "called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin\n",
      "wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses\n",
      "and making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,\n",
      "looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new\n",
      "one.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\n",
      "cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.\n",
      "No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\n",
      "Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\n",
      "arms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\n",
      "heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others\n",
      "laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,\n",
      "bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box\n",
      "of flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all\n",
      "were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are\n",
      "altogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here's a note,\" put in the\n",
      "maid, holding it to Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn't know you had a lover,\" cried the\n",
      "girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg\n",
      "simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\n",
      "into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\n",
      "pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\n",
      "cheered her up by their beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\n",
      "herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\n",
      "breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\n",
      "Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the sweetest little thing\n",
      "she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\n",
      "Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest\n",
      "went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\n",
      "face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and\n",
      "fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very\n",
      "shabby now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\n",
      "heart's content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three\n",
      "compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a\n",
      "remarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little girl\n",
      "with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with\n",
      "her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he\n",
      "gracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till\n",
      "she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.\n",
      "She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner\n",
      "to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of\n",
      "the flowery wall...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How old is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?  Sallie\n",
      "says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. M.  has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\n",
      "early as it is.  The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Moffat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up\n",
      "when the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She'd be so nice if\n",
      "she was only got up in style.  Do you think she'd be offended if we\n",
      "offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\" asked another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlaton\n",
      "is all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good\n",
      "excuse for offering a decent one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and\n",
      "rather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,\n",
      "for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what\n",
      "she had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she\n",
      "could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to\n",
      "forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M.  has\n",
      "made her plans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlaton,\" till\n",
      "she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for\n",
      "advice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and\n",
      "being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an\n",
      "effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she\n",
      "was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till\n",
      "her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.\n",
      "Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and\n",
      "much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived\n",
      "as happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled\n",
      "by the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a\n",
      "little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,\n",
      "who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be\n",
      "contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter\n",
      "was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby\n",
      "dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\n",
      "resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\n",
      "speaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled\n",
      "that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\n",
      "to take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends\n",
      "struck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,\n",
      "took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\n",
      "eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered\n",
      "her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from\n",
      "her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\n",
      "Thursday.  We should like to know him, and it's only a proper\n",
      "compliment to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\n",
      "demurely, \"You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not, Cherie?\" asked Miss Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's too old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My child, what do you mean?  What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried\n",
      "Miss Clara.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches to hide\n",
      "the merriment in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You sly creature!  Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss\n",
      "Belle, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.\"  And Meg laughed also\n",
      "at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\n",
      "supposed lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About your age,\" Nan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,\n",
      "tossing her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?\" said Annie,\n",
      "looking wise about nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are\n",
      "so fond of them.  My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\n",
      "so it is quite natural that we children should play together,\" and Meg\n",
      "hoped they would say no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\" returned Miss Belle\n",
      "with a shrug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls.  Can I do\n",
      "anything for you, young ladies?\" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like\n",
      "an elephant in silk and lace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you, ma'am,\" replied Sallie.  \"I've got my new pink silk for\n",
      "Thursday and don't want a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I...\" began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she\n",
      "did want several things and could not have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you wear?\" asked Sallie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly\n",
      "torn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\n",
      "very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you send home for another?\" said Sallie, who was not an\n",
      "observing young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any other.\"  It cost Meg an effort to say that, but\n",
      "Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, \"Only that?\n",
      "How funny...\"  She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head\n",
      "at her and broke in, saying kindly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she\n",
      "isn't out yet?  There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had\n",
      "a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown,\n",
      "and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, it does\n",
      "well enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to\n",
      "do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and\n",
      "there.  I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and then we'll\n",
      "burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,\"\n",
      "said Belle in her persuasive tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if\n",
      "she would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her to accept\n",
      "and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and\n",
      "between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled\n",
      "her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\n",
      "touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense\n",
      "would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled.  They\n",
      "laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\n",
      "breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\n",
      "the mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\n",
      "brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink\n",
      "silk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and\n",
      "a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,\n",
      "and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her\n",
      "heart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder\n",
      "holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\n",
      "satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,\n",
      "clasping her hands in an affected rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\n",
      "where the others were waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings\n",
      "tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\n",
      "fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\n",
      "she was 'a little beauty'.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\n",
      "enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in\n",
      "the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like\n",
      "a party of magpies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt\n",
      "and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver\n",
      "butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\n",
      "Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\"\n",
      "said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere\n",
      "beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I\n",
      "assure you.  Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be\n",
      "sure you don't trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\n",
      "prettier than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs\n",
      "and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early\n",
      "guests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm\n",
      "about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures\n",
      "their respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\n",
      "before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young\n",
      "gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only\n",
      "stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but\n",
      "agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,\n",
      "and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air\n",
      "of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for\n",

      "champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 'like a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.\n",

      "leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher\n",
      "stooped to pick up her fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things.\n",
      "Tomorrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers' and be desperately\n",
      "good again,\" she answered with an affected little laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wish tomorrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,\n",
      "ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.\n",
      "After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\n",
      "upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\n",
      "scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got\n",
      "no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\n",
      "good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\n",
      "already begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence a la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as\n",
      "he went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too\n",
      "tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\n",
      "masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was\n",
      "sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with\n",
      "her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in the lap of luxury'\n",
      "long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\n",
      "the time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,\" said Meg,\n",
      "looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\n",
      "and Jo on the Sunday evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\n",
      "dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who\n",
      "had given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick\n",
      "to see any change in children's faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a\n",
      "charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her\n",
      "spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat\n",
      "thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.\n",
      "As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her\n",
      "chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee,\n",
      "saying bravely...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marmee, I want to 'fess'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so.  What is it, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not.  Don't I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to\n",
      "speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the\n",
      "dreadful things I did at the Moffats'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little\n",
      "anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they\n",
      "powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a\n",
      "fashion-plate.  Laurie thought I wasn't proper.  I know he did, though\n",
      "he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'.  I knew it was silly,\n",
      "but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of\n",
      "nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\n",
      "face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to\n",
      "blame her little follies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was\n",
      "altogether abominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is something more, I think.\"  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft\n",
      "cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\n",
      "people say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats',\n",
      "and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill\n",
      "pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\" cried Jo\n",
      "indignantly.  \"Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn't help hearing at\n",
      "first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I\n",
      "ought to go away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle\n",
      "such ridiculous stuff.  The idea of having 'plans' and being kind to\n",
      "Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by!  Won't he shout\n",
      "when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\"\n",
      "And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good\n",
      "joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you!  She mustn't, must she,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\n",
      "can,\" said Mrs. March gravely.  \"I was very unwise to let you go among\n",
      "people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,\n",
      "ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.  I am more\n",
      "sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\n",
      "Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me.  I'll forget all the bad and\n",
      "remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you\n",
      "very much for letting me go.  I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,\n",
      "Mother.  I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till\n",
      "I'm fit to take care of myself.  But it is nice to be praised and\n",
      "admired, and I can't help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half\n",
      "ashamed of the confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\n",
      "become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.\n",
      "Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite\n",
      "the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,\n",
      "Meg.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\n",
      "her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new\n",
      "thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\n",
      "things of that sort.  And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her\n",
      "sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\n",
      "world where she could not follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, do you have 'plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ\n",
      "somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect.  I will tell you some of them,\n",
      "for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\n",
      "heart of yours right, on a very serious subject.  You are young, Meg,\n",
      "but not too young to understand me, and mothers' lips are the fittest\n",
      "to speak of such things to girls like you.  Jo, your turn will come in\n",

      "Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\n",
      "were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\n",

      "serious yet cheery way...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be\n",

      "and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\n",
      "by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\n",
      "woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful\n",
      "experience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait\n",

      "you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.  My dear\n",

      "world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid\n",
      "houses, which are not homes because love is wanting.  Money is a\n",
      "needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I\n",
      "never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.\n",
      "I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved,\n",

      "\"Right, Jo.  Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or\n",

      "decidedly.  \"Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere\n",
      "lover.  Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,\n",
      "but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave\n",
      "these things to time.  Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for\n",
      "homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they\n",
      "are not.  One thing remember, my girls.  Mother is always ready to be\n",
      "your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust\n",

      "The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\n",

      "lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on\n",
      "the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I\n",
      "may be allowed the expression.  It's the old martin house, but I've\n",
      "stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts\n",
      "of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,\n",
      "and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it\n",

      "Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and\n",

      "time before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and\n",
      "everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an\n",
      "unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\n",
      "broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\n",

      "orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,\n",
      "being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never\n",

      "The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished\n",
      "wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as\n",
      "through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and\n",
      "pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,\n",
      "invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,\n",

      "funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's\n",
      "charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.  How they laughed\n",

      "I'm free.  Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!\" exclaimed\n",
      "Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an\n",
      "unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and\n",
      "Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!\" said Jo. \"I was\n",
      "mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have\n",
      "felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a\n",
      "churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry\n",
      "getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to\n",
      "me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly\n",
      "helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me.\n",
      "I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,\n",
      "for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josyphine, won't\n",
      "you--?' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did\n",
      "actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,\" said\n",
      "Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\" observed Amy, tasting\n",
      "her mixture critically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.  It's too warm\n",
      "to be particular about one's parts of speech,\" murmured Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you do all your vacation?\" asked Amy, changing the subject\n",
      "with tact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\" replied Meg, from the depths\n",
      "of the rocking chair.  \"I've been routed up early all winter and had to\n",
      "spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and\n",
      "revel to my heart's content.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Jo, \"that dozy way wouldn't suit me.  I've laid in a heap of\n",
      "books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in\n",
      "the old apple tree, when I'm not having l----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say 'larks!'\" implored Amy, as a return snub for the 'samphire'\n",
      "correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll say 'nightingales' then, with Laurie.  That's proper and\n",
      "appropriate, since he's a warbler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time\n",
      "and rest, as the girls mean to,\" proposed Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.  I want to learn some new songs,\n",
      "and my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully\n",
      "out of order and really suffering for clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May we, Mother?\" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in\n",
      "what they called 'Marmee's corner'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I\n",
      "think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as\n",
      "bad as all work and no play.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I'm sure,\" said Meg complacently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', says.\n",
      "Fun forever, and no grubbing!\" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the\n",
      "lemonade went round.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the\n",
      "rest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.\n",
      "Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely\n",
      "and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and\n",
      "Amy's books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but\n",
      "'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to 'rest\n",
      "and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses\n",
      "she would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with\n",
      "Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide\n",
      "World_, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out\n",
      "of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before\n",
      "half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her\n",
      "music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her\n",
      "bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to\n",
      "draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who\n",
      "the young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive\n",
      "daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,\n",
      "got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.\n",
      "\n",
      "At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a\n",
      "delightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the\n",
      "afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had\n",
      "cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her\n",
      "slightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a\n",
      "raging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion\n",
      "of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\n",
      "once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\n",
      "Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she\n",
      "had 'nothing to wear'.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured\n",
      "their mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said\n",
      "nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home\n",
      "pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was\n",
      "astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\n",
      "produced by the 'resting and reveling' process.  The days kept getting\n",
      "longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were\n",
      "tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found\n",
      "plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,\n",
      "Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,\n",
      "that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to\n",
      "furbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she\n",
      "was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\n",
      "quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\n",
      "she had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was\n",
      "constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell\n",
      "back into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected\n",
      "her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so\n",
      "that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her\n",
      "she was 'a fright'.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were\n",
      "small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found\n",
      "that accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn't\n",
      "like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the\n",
      "time.  Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless\n",
      "very well conducted.  \"If one could have a fine house, full of nice\n",
      "girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at\n",
      "home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try\n",
      "the patience of a Boaz,\" complained Miss Malaprop, after several days\n",
      "devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday\n",
      "night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was\n",
      "nearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\n",
      "had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\n",
      "appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls\n",
      "enjoy the full effect of the play system.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\n",
      "no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us!  What has happened?\" cried Jo, staring about her in\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather\n",
      "bewildered, and a little ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\n",
      "quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It's a very\n",
      "queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself.  But she\n",
      "says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take\n",
      "care of ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to\n",
      "do, that is, some new amusement, you know,\" added Jo quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and\n",
      "they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's\n",
      "saying, \"Housekeeping ain't no joke.\"  There was plenty of food in the\n",
      "larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\n",
      "wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think\n",
      "of her, for she'd take care of herself,\" said Meg, who presided and\n",
      "felt quite matronly behind the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the\n",
      "cook's compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet\n",
      "scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March\n",
      "received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo\n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they\n",
      "won't suffer, and it will do them good,\" she said, producing the more\n",
      "palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of\n",
      "the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly\n",
      "little deception for which they were grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook\n",
      "at her failures.  \"Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you\n",
      "be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\" said\n",
      "Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the\n",
      "parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the\n",
      "sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with\n",
      "perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the\n",
      "quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having\n",
      "company,\" said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some\n",
      "asparagus and a lobster, 'for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll have\n",
      "lettuce and make a salad.  I don't know how, but the book tells.  I'll\n",
      "have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you\n",
      "want to be elegant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but\n",
      "gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the\n",
      "dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own\n",
      "responsibility, you may just take care of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the\n",
      "pudding.  You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?\"\n",
      "asked Jo, rather hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You\n",
      "had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,\" returned Meg\n",
      "prudently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I shall.  I'm not a fool.\"  And Jo went off in a huff at the\n",
      "doubts expressed of her powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get what you like, and don't disturb me.  I'm going out to dinner and\n",
      "can't worry about things at home,\" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\n",
      "her.  \"I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation\n",
      "today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and\n",
      "reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural\n",
      "phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic\n",
      "eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything is out of sorts, somehow,\" she said to herself, going\n",
      "downstairs.  \"There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is\n",
      "wrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to\n",
      "find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with\n",
      "his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for\n",
      "want of which he had died.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop left.\n",
      "Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?\" cried Beth, taking\n",
      "the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding\n",
      "him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a\n",
      "coffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\" said Amy\n",
      "hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.  I'll make\n",
      "him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have\n",
      "another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\" murmured\n",
      "Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don't\n",
      "cry, Bethy.  It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has\n",
      "had the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my\n",
      "box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral,\"\n",
      "said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which\n",
      "was in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,\n",
      "she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when\n",
      "she discovered that the fire was out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a sweet prospect!\" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,\n",
      "and poking vigorously among the cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the\n",
      "water heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself\n",
      "that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a\n",
      "very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\n",
      "strawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and\n",
      "the stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\n",
      "worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and\n",
      "forgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when\n",
      "the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure\n",
      "appeared, demanding tartly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high\n",
      "as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the\n",
      "sour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,\n",
      "after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a\n",
      "word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear\n",
      "departed lay in state in the domino box.  A straLanguage cannot describe\n",
      "nge sense of\n",
      "helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the\n",
      "corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker\n",
      "appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,\n",
      "yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw\n",
      "everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had\n",
      "been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and\n",
      "had few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain\n",
      "her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories\n",
      "of the people whom she knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions\n",
      "which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a\n",
      "standing joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\n",
      "and discovered that something more than energy and good will is\n",
      "necessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was\n",
      "grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\n",
      "The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that\n",
      "she could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to\n",
      "her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager\n",
      "proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had\n",
      "to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\n",
      "the last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe\n",
      "as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only\n",
      "it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\"\n",
      "thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\n",
      "stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\n",
      "another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\n",
      "Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\n",
      "his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo's one\n",
      "strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a\n",
      "pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,\n",
      "and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and\n",
      "everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea\n",
      "of cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some\n",
      "water hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,\n",
      "for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but\n",
      "he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\n",
      "mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of\n",
      "delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\n",
      "napkin, and left the table precipitately.\n",
      "\n",

      "Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had\n",
      "given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\n",
      "on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\n",
      "refrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when\n",
      "she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic\n",
      "efforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\n",
      "laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even\n",
      "'Croaker' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner\n",
      "ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\n",

      "ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's\n",
      "dinner table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.  Laurie dug a grave under\n",
      "the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his\n",
      "tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\n",
      "violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\n",
      "composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Here lies Pip March,\n",
      "    Who died the 7th of June;\n",
      "    Loved and lamented sore,\n",
      "    And not forgotten soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\n",
      "with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the\n",
      "beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\n",
      "the pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the\n",
      "remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so\n",
      "tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\n",
      "cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came\n",
      "home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\n",
      "afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success\n",
      "of one part of the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was\n",
      "a scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands\n",
      "done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last\n",
      "minute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on\n",
      "the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each\n",
      "groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a dreadful day this has been!\" began Jo, usually the first to\n",
      "speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit like home,\" added Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\" sighed Beth, glancing\n",
      "with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you\n",
      "want it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as\n",
      "if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another\n",
      "week of it?\" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned\n",
      "toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't!\" cried Jo decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" echoed the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a\n",
      "little for others, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lounging and larking doesn't pay,\" observed Jo, shaking her head. \"I'm\n",
      "tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That's a useful accomplishment,\n",
      "which no woman should be without,\" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly\n",
      "at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker\n",
      "and heard her account of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd\n",
      "get on?\" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing\n",
      "her share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\n",
      "pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable.  So I\n",
      "thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when\n",
      "everyone thinks only of herself.  Don't you feel that it is pleasanter\n",
      "to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when\n",
      "it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and\n",
      "lovely to us all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do, Mother, we do!\" cried the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for\n",
      "though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as\n",
      "we learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for\n",
      "everyone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and\n",
      "spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than\n",
      "money or fashion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\"I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,\n",
      "Marmee.  I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing. That will be\n",
      "better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\n",
      "they are.\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\n",
      "and dolls.  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not\n",
      "playing,\" was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example by\n",
      "heroically declaring, \"I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to\n",
      "my parts of speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\n",
      "that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme\n",
      "and delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each\n",
      "day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth\n",
      "of time by employing it well.  Then youth will be delightful, old age\n",
      "will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite\n",
      "of poverty.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What a sly fellow Laurie is!  I said I wished bigger hats were the\n",

      "offending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the\n",
      "paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and\n",
      "effective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle\n",

      "carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful\n",
      "boys.  One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big. It\n",

      "Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial\n",

      "lively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss\n",
      "Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls\n",
      "would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's\n",
      "assurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why\n",
      "Laurie 'primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young\n",
      "lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with\n",
      "the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an\n",
      "observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not\n",
      "'dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that\n",
      "account.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and\n",
      "after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly\n",

      "\n",
      "Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\n",

      "boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous\n",
      "twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a\n",
      "disturbed water bug.  Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it\n",
      "was of general utility.  It broke the ice in the beginning by producing\n",
      "a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as\n",
      "she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if\n",
      "a shower came up, she said.  Miss Kate decided that she was 'odd', but\n",
      "rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.\n",

      "Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with\n",

      "quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful\n",
      "knowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good\n",
      "deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,\n",
      "being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it\n",
      "their bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very\n",
      "good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.\n",
      "Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and\n",

      "It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets\n",
      "down by the time they arrived.  A pleasant green field, with three\n",

      "\n",
      "Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\n",

      "Jo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,\n",
      "and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of\n",
      "'76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once\n",
      "narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had\n",
      "missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was\n",
      "close behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his\n",
      "ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was\n",
      "very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\n",
      "toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm through!  Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\n",
      "the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You pushed it.  I saw you.  It's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I didn't move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\n",
      "allowed.  So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\n",

      "colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\n",
      "with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out\n",
      "with much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long\n",
      "time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and\n",
      "quiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to\n",
      "regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side\n",
      "had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the\n",

      "\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo,\n",
      "with a look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\"\n",
      "she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a\n",
      "clever stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\n",
      "over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer\n",
      "to whisper to his friend, \"Good for you, Jo!  He did cheat, I saw him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\n",

      "so I hope he'll keep out of my way,\" returned Jo, biting her lips as\n",

      "Sallie, and I spread the table?  Who can make good coffee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo can,\" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that\n",
      "her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\n",
      "the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\n",
      "made a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched\n",
      "and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\n",
      "to serve as plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an\n",
      "inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with\n",
      "green leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone\n",
      "settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and\n",
      "exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for\n",
      "everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter\n",
      "startled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing\n",
      "inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and\n",
      "plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the\n",
      "refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down\n",
      "from the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children\n",
      "peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the\n",
      "other side of the river with all his might and main.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's salt here,\" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I prefer spiders,\" she replied, fishing up two unwary\n",
      "little ones who had gone to a creamy death.  \"How dare you remind me of\n",
      "that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?\" added\n",
      "Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\n",
      "This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything.  It's you and\n",
      "Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you.  What\n",
      "shall we do when we can't eat anymore?\" asked Laurie, feeling that his\n",
      "trump card had been played when lunch was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have games till it's cooler.  I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss\n",

      "you ought to stay with her more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you company too?  I thought she'd suit Brooke, but he keeps\n",
      "talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\n",
      "glass of hers.  I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\n",
      "you can't do it, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and\n",
      "the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing\n",
      "room to play Rig-marole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\n",
      "he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\n",
      "the next takes it up and does the same.  It's very funny when well\n",
      "done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh\n",
      "over.  Please start it, Mr. Brooke,\" said Kate, with a commanding air,\n",
      "which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any\n",
      "other gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\n",
      "obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\n",

      "\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\n",
      "for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long\n",
      "while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till\n",
      "he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to\n",
      "anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he\n",
      "was very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,\n",
      "for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new\n",
      "master, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his\n",
      "lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the\n",
      "city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful\n",
      "face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One\n",
      "day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a\n",
      "ruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived\n",
      "in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were\n",
      "kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their\n",
      "liberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he\n",
      "was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and\n",
      "longing to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into\n",
      "the castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The\n",
      "great door flew open, and he beheld...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\n",
      "last!  At last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and\n",
      "admired the style.  \"'Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her\n",
      "feet in an ecstasy of joy.  'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of\n",
      "marble fairness.  'Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore\n",
      "the knight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain\n",
      "here till my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the\n",
      "mauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and\n",
      "return victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away,\n",
      "and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when\n",
      "he received...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\n",
      "black gown fired at him,\" said Ned.  \"Instantly, Sir What's-his-name\n",
      "recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\n",
      "join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door\n",
      "locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when\n",
      "the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet\n",
      "below.  Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came\n",
      "to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads\n",
      "together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling\n",
      "exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a\n",
      "pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as\n",
      "your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss\n",
      "March.  At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took\n",
      "his breath away and chilled his blood...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in\n",
      "its wasted hand,\" went on Meg.  \"It beckoned, gliding noiselessly\n",
      "before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.  Shadowy\n",
      "effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the\n",
      "lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face\n",
      "toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil.\n",
      "They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.  He\n",
      "sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved\n",
      "threateningly before him a...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Snuffbox,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\n",
      "audience.  \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and\n",
      "sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.  'Ha! Ha!'\n",
      "laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the\n",
      "princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\n",
      "victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\n",
      "knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all\n",
      "rose and began to...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dance a hornpipe,\" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, \"and, as they\n",
      "danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail.\n",
      "'Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man\n",
      "the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight,\n",
      "with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\n",
      "hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous fight began.  Of course\n",
      "the British beat--they always do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, they don't!\" cried Jo, aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\n",
      "schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers\n",
      "ran blood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosun's\n",
      "mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if\n",
      "he doesn't confess his sins double quick,' said the British captain.\n",
      "The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,\n",
      "while the jolly tars cheered like mad.  But the sly dog dived, came up\n",
      "under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail\n",
      "set, 'To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, gracious!  What shall I say?\" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\n",
      "rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases\n",
      "and facts out of one of his favorite books. \"Well, they went to the\n",
      "bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\n",
      "finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\n",
      "hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was\n",
      "curious.  By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\n",
      "you a box of pearls if you can take it up,' for she wanted to restore\n",
      "the poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.  So\n",
      "the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to\n",
      "find no pearls.  He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\n",
      "by a...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\n",
      "Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out.  \"The little girl was sorry for\n",
      "them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them.  'Your\n",
      "geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the old woman.  So she\n",
      "asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\n",
      "and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly.  \"'Just the thing,' said the\n",
      "girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\n",
      "the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\n",
      "rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\n",
      "heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it.  The\n",
      "knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\n",
      "learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and\n",
      "married, but one.  He was in a great state of mind at that, and\n",
      "mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to\n",
      "the castle to see which was left.  Peeping over the hedge, he saw the\n",
      "queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden.  'Will you give\n",
      "me a rose?' said he.  'You must come and get it.  I can't come to you,\n",
      "it isn't proper,' said she, as sweet as honey.  He tried to climb over\n",
      "the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.  Then he tried to\n",
      "push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.\n",
      "So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole\n",
      "through which he peeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in!  Let me in!'\n",
      "But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her\n",
      "roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.  Whether he did or\n",
      "not, Frank will tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't.  I'm not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\n",
      "sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd\n",
      "couple.  Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?\" asked\n",
      "Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\n",
      "his buttonhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a\n",

      "\"What a piece of nonsense we have made!  With practice we might do\n",
      "something quite clever.  Do you know Truth?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The game, I mean?\"\n",

      "\"What is it?\" said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn,\n",
      "and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question\n",
      "put by the rest.  It's great fun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's try it,\" said Jo, who liked new experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\n",
      "and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What silly questions you ask!\"  And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the\n",

      "\"Try again.  Truth isn't a bad game,\" said Fred.\n",

      "\"It's a very good one for you,\" retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn\n",
      "came next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your greatest fault?\" asked Fred, by way of testing in her the\n",
      "virtue he lacked himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A quick temper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you most wish for?\" said Laurie.\n",

      "\"A pair of boot lacings,\" returned Jo, guessing and defeating his\n",

      "\"Not a true answer.  You must say what you really do want most.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, \"Young ladies in America love\n",

      "respected for supporting themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so.  We\n",
      "have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and\n",

      "gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,\" said\n",
      "Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and made her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did the German song suit, Miss March?\" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!  It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not very well.  My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on\n",

      "Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used\n",
      "to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of\n",
      "the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.  Down the\n",
      "page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in\n",
      "the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little\n",
      "touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen\n",
      "the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked\n",
      "up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well indeed!\" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her\n",
      "many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little\n",
      "tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,\n",
      "\"You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader.  I advise\n",
      "you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers.  I\n",
      "must look after Grace, she is romping.\" And Miss Kate strolled away,\n",
      "adding to herself with a shrug, \"I didn't come to chaperone a\n",
      "governess, though she is young and pretty.  What odd people these\n",
      "Yankees are.  I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses\n",
      "and don't treat them as we do,\" said Meg, looking after the retreating\n",
      "figure with an annoyed expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my\n",
      "sorrow.  There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.\"\n",

      "lament her hard lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad I live in it then.  I don't like my work, but I get a good\n",
      "deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain. I only\n",
      "wished I liked teaching as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.  I shall be very\n",

      "the turf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going to college, I suppose?\" Meg's lips asked the question, but her\n",
      "eyes added, \"And what becomes of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is\n",
      "off, I shall turn soldier.  I am needed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad of that!\" exclaimed Meg.  \"I should think every young man\n",
      "would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who\n",
      "stay at home,\" she added sorrowfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the\n",
      "hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all\n",
      "be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\" said Meg heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, that sounds pleasant,\" began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful\n",
      "again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old\n",
      "horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the\n",
      "young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you love to ride?\" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting\n",
      "after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dote upon it.  My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but\n",
      "we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\" added Amy, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me about Ellen Tree.  Is it a donkey?\" asked Grace curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've only got\n",
      "an old sidesaddle and no horse.  Out in our garden is an apple tree\n",
      "that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some\n",
      "reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree\n",
      "whenever we like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How funny!\" laughed Grace.  \"I have a pony at home, and ride nearly\n",
      "every day in the park with Fred and Kate.  It's very nice, for my\n",
      "friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, how charming!  I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd rather\n",
      "go to Rome than the Row,\" said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what\n",
      "the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were\n",
      "saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture\n",
      "as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical\n",
      "gymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,\n",
      "looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, \"I'm afraid you are\n",
      "tired.  Can I do anything for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Talk to me, please.  It's dull, sitting by myself,\" answered Frank,\n",
      "who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a\n",
      "more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,\n",
      "no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her\n",
      "that she bravely resolved to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you like to talk about?\" she asked, fumbling over the cards\n",
      "and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\" said\n",
      "Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart!  What shall I do?  I don't know anything about them, thought\n",
      "Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,\n",
      "hoping to make him talk, \"I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\n",
      "know all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\n",
      "confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for\n",
      "me,\" said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her\n",
      "innocent blunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\" she said,\n",
      "turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one\n",
      "of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to\n",
      "amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her\n",
      "sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking\n",
      "away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged\n",
      "protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless her heart!  She pities him, so she is good to him,\" said Jo,\n",
      "beaming at her from the croquet ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always said she was a little saint,\" added Meg, as if there could be\n",
      "no further doubt of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\" said Grace to\n",
      "Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn\n",
      "cups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,\" said\n",
      "Amy, well pleased at Beth's success.  She meant 'facinating', but as\n",
      "Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded\n",
      "well and made a good impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet\n",
      "finished the afternoon.  At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,\n",
      "wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the\n",
      "river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,\n",
      "warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,\n",

      "\n",
      "he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed\n",
      "outright and spoiled his song.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you be so cruel to me?\" he whispered, under cover of a lively\n",
      "chorus.  \"You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,\"\n",
      "replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was\n",
      "quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and\n",
      "the talk after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her\n",
      "rather pettishly, \"There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\"\n",

      "\"Not a particle, but she's a dear,\" returned Sallie, defending her\n",
      "friend even while confessing her shortcomings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's not a stricken deer anyway,\" said Ned, trying to be witty, and\n",

      "On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with\n",

      "Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm\n",
      "September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\n",
      "lazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had\n",
      "been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\n",
      "live it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\n",
      "shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\n",
      "displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened\n",
      "the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that\n",
      "one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman\n",
      "about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\n",
      "hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\n",
      "peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up\n",
      "into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed\n",
      "dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the\n",
      "ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him\n",
      "ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw\n",
      "the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the world are those girls about now?\" thought Laurie, opening\n",
      "his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\n",
      "peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,\n",
      "flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried\n",
      "a long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a\n",
      "portfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little\n",
      "back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and\n",
      "river.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's cool,\" said Laurie to himself, \"to have a picnic and\n",
      "never ask me!  They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got\n",
      "the key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I'll take it to them, and see what's\n",
      "going on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find\n",
      "one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in\n",
      "his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped\n",
      "the fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the\n",
      "boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went\n",
      "up the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part\n",
      "of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than\n",
      "the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\n",
      "looking wide-awake and good-natured already.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in\n",
      "the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic\n",
      "wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the\n",
      "little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no\n",
      "strangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily\n",
      "with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her\n",
      "pink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick\n",
      "under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy\n",
      "was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.\n",
      "A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he\n",
      "ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed\n",
      "very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his\n",
      "restless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its\n",
      "harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and\n",
      "skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the\n",
      "wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?\" he asked, advancing\n",
      "slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at\n",
      "once, \"Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we\n",
      "thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no objection, if you do something.  It's against the rules to be\n",
      "idle here,\" replied Meg gravely but graciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged.  I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's\n",
      "as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,\n",
      "draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.\"  And Laurie\n",
      "sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Finish this story while I set my heel,\" said Jo, handing him the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes'm.\" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his\n",
      "gratitude for the favor of admission into the 'Busy Bee Society'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming\n",
      "institution is a new one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you tell him?\" asked Meg of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll laugh,\" said Amy warningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who cares?\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess he'll like it,\" added Beth.\n",
      "\n",

      "and don't be afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know,\" said Laurie, nodding wisely.\n",

      "\"Who told you?\" demanded Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,\n",
      "and he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,\" said\n",
      "Beth meekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go on, please,\" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,\n",
      "looking a trifle displeased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have\n",
      "tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at\n",
      "it with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\n",
      "and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I should think so,\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own\n",
      "idle days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring\n",
      "our work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our\n",
      "things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\n",
      "and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the\n",
      "Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where\n",
      "we hope to live some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the\n",
      "wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\n",
      "other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green\n",
      "hills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens\n",
      "glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset.  Gold and purple clouds\n",
      "lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery\n",
      "white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see\n",
      "and feel beauty of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\n",
      "always splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the real\n",
      "country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be\n",
      "nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\n",
      "ever go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,\n",
      "by-and-by, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg with her sweetest\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.  I want to fly away at once,\n",
      "as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,\" said Jo.\n",
      "\"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\n",
      "maybe never get in after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort.  I shall have to do\n",
      "a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City.  If\n",
      "I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she said\n",
      "cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \"If people\n",
      "really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will\n",
      "get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that door or any\n",
      "guards at the gate.  I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,\n",
      "where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor\n",
      "Christian as he comes up from the river.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\n",
      "come true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,\"\n",
      "said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\n",
      "betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd have to take your favorite one.  What is it?\" asked Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will.  Now, Laurie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle\n",
      "in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.  I'm to be a famous\n",
      "musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me.  And I'm never\n",
      "to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live\n",
      "for what I like.  That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a\n",
      "brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she\n",
      "said slowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of\n",
      "luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,\n",
      "pleasant people, and heaps of money.  I am to be mistress of it, and\n",
      "manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a\n",
      "bit.  How I should enjoy it!  For I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and\n",
      "make everyone love me dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?\" asked Laurie\n",
      "slyly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said 'pleasant people', you know,\" and Meg carefully tied up her\n",
      "shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some\n",
      "angelic little children?  You know your castle wouldn't be perfect\n",
      "without,\" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\n",
      "scorned romance, except in books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\"\n",
      "answered Meg petulantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't I though?  I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\n",
      "piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that\n",
      "my works should be as famous as Laurie's music.  I want to do something\n",
      "splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that\n",
      "won't be forgotten after I'm dead.  I don't know what, but I'm on the\n",
      "watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.  I think I shall\n",
      "write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my\n",
      "favorite dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take\n",
      "care of the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.  I only wish we\n",
      "may all keep well and be together, nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\n",
      "to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\n",
      "world,\" was Amy's modest desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're an ambitious set, aren't we?  Every one of us, but Beth, wants\n",
      "to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if\n",
      "any of us will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass like a\n",
      "meditative calf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the\n",
      "door remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang\n",
      "college!\" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In your face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, that's of no use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,\" replied\n",
      "the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\n",
      "fancied he knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across\n",
      "the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn\n",
      "when he told the story of the knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of\n",
      "us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,\" said\n",
      "Jo, always ready with a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me!  How old I shall be, twenty-seven!\" exclaimed Meg, who felt\n",
      "grown up already, having just reached seventeen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy\n",
      "twenty-two.  What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but\n",
      "I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure\n",
      "you'll work splendidly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is she?  By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\n",
      "sitting up with sudden energy.  \"I ought to be satisfied to please\n",
      "Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\n",
      "and comes hard.  He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and\n",
      "I'd rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\n",
      "rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\n",
      "bottom when I own them.  Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if\n",
      "I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But\n",
      "he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and\n",
      "please myself, as my father did.  If there was anyone left to stay with\n",
      "the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\n",
      "execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast\n",
      "and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\n",
      "subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\n",
      "again till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\n",
      "fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\n",
      "excited by what she called 'Teddy's Wrongs'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not right, Jo.  You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie\n",
      "mustn't take your bad advice.  You should do just what your grandfather\n",
      "wishes, my dear boy,\" said Meg in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best\n",
      "at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he\n",
      "won't be hard on you or unjust to you.  As you say, there is no one\n",
      "else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you\n",
      "left him without his permission.  Don't be dismal or fret, but do your\n",
      "duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being\n",
      "respected and loved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\n",
      "advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\n",
      "from himself after his unusual outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his\n",
      "own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\n",
      "person because he wouldn't leave her.  And how he provides now for an\n",
      "old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as\n",
      "generous and patient and good as he can be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\n",
      "looking flushed and earnest with her story.  \"It's like Grandpa to find\n",
      "out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his\n",
      "goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\n",
      "understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me\n",
      "and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was\n",
      "just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about\n",
      "you all in flaming style.  If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll\n",
      "do for Brooke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\n",
      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know I do, Miss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can always tell by his face when he goes away.  If you have been\n",
      "good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.  If you have plagued him,\n",
      "he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\n",
      "better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I like that?  So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\n",
      "Brooke's face, do you?  I see him bow and smile as he passes your\n",
      "window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We haven't.  Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything!\n",
      "It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here\n",
      "is said in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the\n",
      "thought of what might follow from her careless speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't tell tales,\" replied Laurie, with his 'high and mighty' air,\n",
      "as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \"Only if\n",
      "Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather\n",
      "for him to report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't be offended.  I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\n",
      "silly.  I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd\n",
      "be sorry for by-and-by.  You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were\n",
      "our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\"\n",
      "And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\n",
      "and said frankly, \"I'm the one to be forgiven.  I'm cross and have been\n",
      "out of sorts all day.  I like to have you tell me my faults and be\n",
      "sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes.  I thank you all the\n",
      "same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\n",
      "as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\n",
      "down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\n",
      "fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee Society'.  In the midst of an\n",
      "animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\n",
      "amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound\n",
      "of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea 'to draw', and they\n",
      "would just have time to get home to supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer\n",
      "are told to do,\" said Meg, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.\n",
      "There's a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers like a big\n",
      "blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,\n",
      "standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,\n",
      "whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old\n",
      "man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts\n",
      "of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of\n",
      "the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\n",
      "sacrifice cheerfully, \"I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear\n",

      "Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\n",
      "chilly, and the afternoons were short.  For two or three hours the sun\n",
      "lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\n",
      "writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\n",
      "while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\n",
      "by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\n",
      "his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\n",
      "last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and\n",
      "threw down her pen, exclaiming...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, I've done my best!  If this won't suit I shall have to wait\n",
      "till I can do better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\n",
      "making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\n",
      "which looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart\n",
      "red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful\n",
      "expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo's\n",
      "desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it\n",
      "she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,\n",
      "who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a\n",
      "circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the\n",
      "leaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and\n",
      "putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her\n",
      "friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.\n",
      "\n",
      "She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to\n",
      "the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\n",
      "herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\n",
      "Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\n",
      "away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements\n",
      "decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till\n",
      "she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found\n",
      "the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up\n",
      "the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly\n",
      "dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This\n",
      "maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\n",
      "black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\n",
      "opposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\n",
      "pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\n",
      "she were going to have all her teeth out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\n",
      "and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\n",
      "opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\n",
      "gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\n",
      "in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, \"It's like\n",
      "her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need someone to\n",
      "help her home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the\n",
      "general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\n",
      "ordeal of some sort.  When she saw the young gentleman she looked\n",
      "anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod.  But he followed,\n",

      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "we'll never desert you.  I don't know what I should do if you acted\n",
      "like Mr. King's son.  He had plenty of money, but didn't know how to\n",
      "spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his\n",

      "\n",
      "Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\n",

      "as if at her warnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?\" he asked\n",

      "tell me yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any,\" began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that\n",
      "she had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and 'fess, or I\n",

      "\"Is your secret a nice one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, isn't it!  All about people you know, and such fun!  You ought to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to give his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\" cried\n",
      "Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight\n",
      "of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,\n",
      "for they were out of the city now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It won't fail.  Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare\n",

      "fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our authoress?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a\n",
      "friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's your secret?  Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you\n",
      "again,\" she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not to, so I\n",
      "will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy\n",
      "bit of news I get.  I know where Meg's glove is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and\n",
      "twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you\n",
      "where it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a\n",
      "comical change.  She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both\n",
      "surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \"How do you\n",
      "know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saw it.\"\n",

      "\"All this time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, isn't that romantic?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't you like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I don't.  It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed.  My\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are not to tell anyone.  Mind that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was understood, and I trusted you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you\n",
      "hadn't told me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd be pleased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to see anyone try it,\" cried Jo fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So should I!\" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind\n",
      "since you told me that,\" said Jo rather ungratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,\" suggested\n",
      "Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and\n",
      "finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat\n",
      "and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached\n",
      "the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his\n",
      "treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright\n",
      "eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,\n",
      "and not lose my breath.  It was capital, but see what a guy it's made\n",
      "me.  Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,\" said Jo,\n",
      "dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with\n",
      "crimson leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled\n",
      "up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.\n",
      "But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking\n",
      "particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been\n",
      "making calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the world are you doing here?\" she asked, regarding her\n",
      "disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Getting leaves,\" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\n",
      "just swept up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And hairpins,\" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.\n",
      "\"They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have been running, Jo.  How could you?  When will you stop such\n",
      "romping ways?\" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and\n",
      "smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don't try to\n",
      "make me grow up before my time, Meg.  It's hard enough to have you\n",
      "change all of a sudden.  Let me be a little girl as long as I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her\n",
      "lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a\n",
      "woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must\n",
      "surely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in\n",
      "her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where\n",
      "have you been calling, all so fine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\n",
      "Moffat's wedding.  It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend\n",
      "the winter in Paris.  Just think how delightful that must be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\n",
      "poor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\n",
      "mind what she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall never '_go_ and marry' anyone,\" observed Meg, walking on with\n",
      "great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping\n",
      "stones, and 'behaving like children', as Meg said to herself, though\n",
      "she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best\n",
      "dress on.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite\n",
      "bewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to\n",
      "Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a\n",
      "woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in\n",
      "a very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to\n",
      "one another, and talking about 'Spread Eagles' till the girls declared\n",
      "they had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out\n",
      "of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by\n",
      "the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally\n",
      "capturing her in Amy's bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,\n",
      "but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices\n",
      "and a great flapping of newspapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we do with that girl?  She never _will_ behave like a young\n",
      "lady,\" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope she won't.  She is so funny and dear as she is,\" said Beth, who\n",
      "had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets\n",
      "with anyone but her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,\" added Amy,\n",
      "who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\n",
      "very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually\n",
      "elegant and ladylike.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\n",
      "to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you anything interesting there?\" asked Meg, with condescension.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,\" returned Jo,\n",
      "carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better read it aloud.  That will amuse us and keep you out of\n",
      "mischief,\" said Amy in her most grown-up tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the name?\" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind\n",
      "the sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Rival Painters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds well.  Read it,\" said Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a loud \"Hem!\" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The\n",
      "girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat\n",
      "pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. \"I like that about\n",
      "the splendid picture,\" was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\n",
      "names, isn't that queer?\" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering\n",
      "part was tragical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who wrote it?\" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\n",
      "countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement\n",
      "replied in a loud voice, \"Your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?\" cried Meg, dropping her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very good,\" said Amy critically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew it!  I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!\"  and Beth ran to hug\n",
      "her sister and exult over this splendid success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!  How Meg wouldn't\n",
      "believe it till she saw the words.  \"Miss Josephine March,\" actually\n",
      "printed in the paper.  How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts\n",
      "of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\n",
      "couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth\n",
      "got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to\n",
      "exclaim, \"Sakes alive, well I never!\" in great astonishment at 'that\n",
      "Jo's doin's'.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo\n",
      "laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a\n",
      "peacock and done with it, and how the 'Spread Eagle' might be said to\n",
      "flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper\n",
      "passed from hand to hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell us about it.\"  \"When did it come?\" \"How much did you get for it?\"\n",
      "\"What will Father say?\" \"Won't Laurie laugh?\" cried the family, all in\n",
      "one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate\n",
      "people made a jubilee of every little household joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,\" said Jo,\n",
      "wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did\n",
      "over her 'Rival Painters'.  Having told how she disposed of her tales,\n",
      "Jo added, \"And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them\n",
      "both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and\n",
      "noticed the stories.  It was good practice, he said, and when the\n",
      "beginners improved, anyone would pay.  So I let him have the two\n",
      "stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it\n",
      "and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.  And he said it was good, and\n",
      "I shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I am\n",
      "so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the\n",
      "girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she\n",
      "bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be\n",

      "\"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.  Just wait ten years,\n",
      "and see if we don't,\" said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as\n",
      "Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,\n",

      "\n",
      "Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.  Jo groaned and\n",
      "leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy\n",
      "spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,\n",
      "said, smiling, \"Two pleasant things are going to happen right away.\n",
      "Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the\n",
      "garden as if he had something nice to tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, \"Any letter from\n",
      "Father, girls?\" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, \"Won't some of\n",
      "you come for a drive?  I've been working away at mathematics till my\n",
      "head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.\n",
      "It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke\n",
      "home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out.  Come, Jo, you and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged, but I'm busy.\"  And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for\n",
      "she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not\n",
      "to drive too often with the young gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We three will be ready in a minute,\" cried Amy, running away to wash\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?\" asked Laurie, leaning over\n",
      "Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear.\n",

      "regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a\n",
      "letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\" she said, handling it\n",
      "as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it\n",
      "contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little\n",
      "paper had sent a bullet to her heart.  Laurie dashed downstairs for\n",
      "water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a\n",
      "frightened voice...\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and\n",

      "children, help me to bear it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the\n",
      "room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,\n",
      "and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.  Poor Hannah was the\n",
      "first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a\n",
      "good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Lord keep the dear man!  I won't waste no time a-cryin', but git\n",
      "your things ready right away, mum,\" she said heartily, as she wiped her\n",
      "face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her\n",
      "own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's right, there's no time for tears now.  Be calm, girls, and let\n",
      "me think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking\n",
      "pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's Laurie?\" she asked presently, when she had collected her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here, ma'am.  Oh, let me do something!\" cried the boy, hurrying from\n",
      "the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow\n",
      "was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send a telegram saying I will come at once.  The next train goes early\n",
      "in the morning.  I'll take that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else?  The horses are ready.  I can go anywhere, do anything,\" he\n",

      "\n",
      "Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew\n",
      "the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad\n",

      "add a little to the sum for her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace.\n",
      "There is no need of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way\n",
      "get these things.  I'll put them down, they'll be needed and I must go\n",
      "prepared for nursing.  Hospital stores are not always good.  Beth, go\n",
      "and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.  I'm not too\n",
      "proud to beg for Father.  He shall have the best of everything.  Amy,\n",

      "\n",
      "Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the\n",

      "while, and let them work.  Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust\n",
      "of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if\n",
      "the paper had been an evil spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the\n",
      "kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest\n",
      "promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which\n",
      "comforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn't offer, from his\n",
      "own dressing gown to himself as escort.  But the last was impossible.\n",
      "Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long\n",
      "journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,\n",
      "for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy\n",
      "eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be\n",
      "back directly.  No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran\n",
      "through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea\n",
      "in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\" he said, in the kind,\n",
      "quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.  \"I\n",
      "came to offer myself as escort to your mother.  Mr. Laurence has\n",
      "commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction\n",
      "to be of service to her there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg\n",
      "put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke\n",
      "would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling\n",
      "one of time and comfort which he was about to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you all are!  Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will be\n",
      "such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.  Thank\n",
      "you very, very much!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the\n",
      "brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and\n",
      "lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from\n",
      "Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what\n",
      "she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd\n",
      "for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come\n",
      "of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.\n",
      "March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on\n",
      "with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo\n",
      "would have understood if she had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg\n",
      "and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy\n",
      "got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a 'slap\n",
      "and a bang', but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and\n",
      "Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take\n",
      "into her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a\n",
      "very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun\n",
      "and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as\n",
      "much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a\n",
      "little choke in her voice, \"That's my contribution toward making Father\n",
      "comfortable and bringing him home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you\n",
      "haven't done anything rash?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's mine honestly.  I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.  I earned\n",
      "it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for\n",
      "all her abundant hair was cut short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your hair!  Your beautiful hair!\"  \"Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one\n",
      "beauty.\"  \"My dear girl, there was no need of this.\"  \"She doesn't look\n",
      "like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo\n",
      "assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,\n",
      "and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked\n",
      "it, \"It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.  It\n",
      "will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will\n",
      "do my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels\n",
      "deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a\n",
      "curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.\n",
      "I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me all about it, Jo.  I am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame\n",
      "you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call\n",
      "it, to your love.  But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid\n",
      "you will regret it one of these days,\" said Mrs. March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I won't!\" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her\n",
      "prank was not entirely condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What made you do it?\" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of\n",
      "cutting off her head as her pretty hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I was wild to do something for Father,\" replied Jo, as they\n",
      "gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the\n",
      "midst of trouble.  \"I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew\n",
      "Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.\n",
      "Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some\n",
      "clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,\n",
      "if I sold the nose off my face to get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got\n",
      "the simplest with your own hard earnings,\" said Mrs. March with a look\n",
      "that warmed Jo's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went\n",
      "along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to\n",
      "dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber's\n",
      "window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,\n",
      "not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden\n",
      "that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to\n",
      "think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give\n",
      "for mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how you dared to do it,\" said Beth in a tone of awe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his\n",
      "hair.  He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls\n",
      "bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.  He said he didn't\n",
      "care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid\n",
      "much for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and\n",
      "so on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right\n",
      "away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to\n",
      "do a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told\n",
      "him why I was in such a hurry.  It was silly, I dare say, but it\n",
      "changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my\n",
      "topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, 'Take it,\n",
      "Thomas, and oblige the young lady.  I'd do as much for our Jimmy any\n",
      "day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was Jimmy?\" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they\n",
      "went along.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her son, she said, who was in the army.  How friendly such things make\n",
      "strangers feel, don't they?  She talked away all the time the man\n",
      "clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\" asked Meg, with a\n",
      "shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that\n",
      "was the end of it.  I never snivel over trifles like that. I will\n",
      "confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on\n",
      "the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost\n",
      "seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and\n",
      "picked out a long lock for me to keep.  I'll give it to you, Marmee,\n",
      "just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't\n",
      "think I shall ever have a mane again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short\n",
      "gray one in her desk.  She only said, \"Thank you, deary,\" but something\n",
      "in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully\n",
      "as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day\n",
      "tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to\n",
      "be nursed.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by the\n",
      "last finished job, and said, \"Come girls.\"  Beth went to the piano and\n",
      "played the father's favorite hymn.  All began bravely, but broke down\n",
      "one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to\n",
      "her music was always a sweet consoler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall need all\n",
      "the sleep we can get.  Good night, my darlings,\" said Mrs. March, as\n",
      "the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\n",
      "\n",
      "They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear\n",
      "invalid lay in the next room.  Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite\n",
      "of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious\n",
      "thoughts she had ever known in her short life.  Jo lay motionless, and\n",
      "her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her\n",
      "exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, what is it?  Are you crying about father?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the\n",
      "afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not sorry,\" protested Jo, with a choke.  \"I'd do it again\n",
      "tomorrow, if I could.  It's only the vain part of me that goes and\n",
      "cries in this silly way.  Don't tell anyone, it's all over now.  I\n",
      "thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my\n",

      "\n",

      "\"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,\"\n",

      "the Hummels were forgotten.  An hour passed.  Amy did not come, Meg\n",
      "went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story,\n",
      "and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly\n",

      "no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room.\n",
      "Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and\n",
      "there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very\n",
      "grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christopher Columbus!  What's the matter?\" cried Jo, as Beth put out\n",
      "her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?\"\n",

      "chair, with a remorseful face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad!  I saw in a minute it was sicker,\n",

      "let Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little\n",
      "cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,\n",
      "and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was\n",
      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't cry, dear!  What did you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor.\n",
      "He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore\n",
      "throats.  'Scarlet fever, ma'am.  Ought to have called me before,' he\n",
      "said crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure\n",
      "baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to\n",
      "help the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and\n",
      "was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned\n",
      "round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right\n",
      "away, or I'd have the fever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't!\" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look.\n",

      "shall we do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly.  I looked in\n",
      "Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and\n",
      "queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel\n",
      "better,\" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and\n",
      "trying to look well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mother was only at home!\" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and\n",
      "feeling that Washington was an immense way off.  She read a page,\n",
      "looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said\n",
      "gravely, \"You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and\n",
      "among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid you are going\n",
      "to have it, Beth.  I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let Amy come.  She never had it, and I should hate to give it to\n",
      "her.  Can't you and Meg have it over again?\" asked Beth, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess not.  Don't care if I do.  Serve me right, selfish pig, to let\n",
      "you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!\" muttered Jo, as she went to\n",
      "consult Hannah.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,\n",
      "assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,\n",
      "and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt\n",
      "much relieved as they went up to call Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Hannah, when she had examined\n",
      "and questioned Beth, \"we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at\n",
      "you, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we'll send Amy off to\n",
      "Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you\n",
      "girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,\" began Meg, looking anxious and\n",
      "self-reproachful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick.  I told Mother I'd do the\n",

      "\"Which will you have, Beth?  There ain't no need of but one,\" aid\n",
      "Hannah.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, please.\" And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a\n",
      "contented look, which effectually settled that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go and tell Amy,\" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather\n",
      "relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather\n",
      "have the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and\n",
      "commanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg\n",
      "left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came\n",
      "back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head\n",
      "in the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,\n",
      "but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\n",
      "whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he\n",
      "sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \"Now be a\n",
      "sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what\n",
      "a jolly plan I've got.  You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take\n",
      "you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.\n",
      "Won't that be better than moping here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\" began Amy, in an\n",
      "injured voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.  You don't want to be\n",
      "sick, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with\n",
      "Beth all the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may\n",
      "escape it.  Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or\n",
      "if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly.  I\n",
      "advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke,\n",
      "miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,\" said Amy, looking\n",
      "rather frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,\n",
      "and take you out gallivanting.  The old lady likes me, and I'll be as\n",
      "sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On my honor as a gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And come every single day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See if I don't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The identical minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And go to the theater, truly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A dozen theaters, if we may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--I guess I will,\" said Amy slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good girl!  Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,\" said Laurie, with\n",
      "an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving in'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been\n",
      "wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised\n",
      "to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is the little dear?\" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet,\n",
      "and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better.  The baby's death\n",
      "troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she\n",
      "thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,\" answered\n",
      "Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a trying world it is!\" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful\n",
      "way.  \"No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another.\n",
      "There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so\n",
      "I'm all at sea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle\n",
      "your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do\n",
      "anything?\" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of\n",
      "his friend's one beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what troubles me,\" said Meg.  \"I think we ought to tell her if\n",
      "Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave\n",
      "Father, and it will only make them anxious.  Beth won't be sick long,\n",
      "and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,\n",
      "so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum, well, I can't say.  Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor\n",
      "has been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will.  Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,\" commanded Meg. \"We can't\n",
      "decide anything till he has been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay where you are, Jo.  I'm errand boy to this establishment,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you are busy,\" began Meg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I've done my lessons for the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you study in vacation time?\" asked Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I follow the good example my neighbors set me,\" was Laurie's answer,\n",
      "as he swung himself out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have great hopes for my boy,\" observed Jo, watching him fly over the\n",
      "fence with an approving smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He does very well, for a boy,\" was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,\n",
      "for the subject did not interest her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she\n",
      "would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.\n",
      "Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off\n",
      "danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\n",

      "Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want now?\" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,\n",
      "while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go away.  No boys allowed here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among\n",
      "poor folks.  Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,\n",
      "which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now.  Don't cry, child,\n",
      "it worries me to hear people sniff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's\n",
      "tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,\n",
      "\"Bless my boots!\" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you hear from your mother?\" asked the old lady gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father is much better,\" replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, is he?  Well, that won't last long, I fancy.  March never had any\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!  Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!\"\n",
      "squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\" cried Polly, tumbling\n",
      "off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the 'rattlepated' boy,\n",
      "who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,\" thought Amy, as she was\n",
      "left alone with Aunt March.\n",

      "Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and\n",
      "the doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\n",
      "Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own\n",
      "way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\n",
      "excellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\n",
      "and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\n",
      "letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness.  She could not\n",
      "think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\n",
      "Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of 'Mrs. March bein' told, and worried\n",
      "just for sech a trifle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was\n",
      "very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could\n",
      "control herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she\n",
      "began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if\n",
      "on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen\n",
      "that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar\n",
      "faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called\n",
      "imploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be\n",
      "allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she 'would think of\n",
      "it, though there was no danger yet'.  A letter from Washington added to\n",
      "their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of\n",
      "coming home for a long while.\n",
      "\n",
      "How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\n",
      "heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\n",
      "the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that\n",
      "Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\n",
      "rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\n",
      "buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\n",
      "life.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\n",
      "suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice\n",
      "sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\n",
      "Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\n",
      "hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to\n",
      "live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple\n",
      "virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\n",
      "than talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly\n",
      "to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no\n",
      "service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful\n",
      "grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.\n",
      "Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked\n",
      "the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\n",
      "neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone\n",
      "missed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\n",
      "did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to\n",
      "get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\n",
      "good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find\n",
      "how many friends shy little Beth had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in\n",
      "her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for\n",
      "her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,\n",
      "and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent\n",
      "loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\n",
      "soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\n",
      "Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\n",
      "intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\n",
      "to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\n",
      "sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\n",
      "Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\n",
      "send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter\n",
      "wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its\n",
      "death.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held\n",
      "the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,\n",
      "saying, in a low voice to Hannah, \"If Mrs. March can leave her husband\n",
      "she'd better be sent for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg\n",
      "dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\n",
      "at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a\n",
      "minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on\n",
      "her things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while\n",
      "noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\n",
      "that Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\n",
      "weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\n",
      "misery that Laurie asked quickly, \"What is it?  Is Beth worse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've sent for Mother,\" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No.  The doctor told us to.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is.  She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the\n",

      "Him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her\n",

      "She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp of the\n",
      "friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her\n",
      "nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting\n",
      "words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as\n",
      "her mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far\n",
      "more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\n",
      "sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection\n",
      "administers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved\n",
      "her, and looked up with a grateful face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.  I don't feel so forlorn, and will\n",
      "try to bear it if it comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother\n",
      "will be here, and then everything will be all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad Father is better.  Now she won't feel so bad about leaving\n",
      "him.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and\n",
      "I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,\" sighed Jo, spreading her wet\n",
      "handkerchief over her knees to dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doesn't Meg pull fair?\" asked Laurie, looking indignant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and she won't\n",
      "miss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her up.\n",
      "I can't!  I can't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried\n",
      "despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a\n",
      "tear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till\n",
      "he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.\n",
      "It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.\n",
      "Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \"I don't think she\n",
      "will die.  She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe\n",
      "God will take her away yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The good and dear people always do die,\" groaned Jo, but she stopped\n",
      "crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own\n",
      "doubts and fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girl, you're worn out.  It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a\n",
      "bit.  I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down\n",
      "on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from\n",
      "the table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for\n",
      "the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and\n",
      "when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a\n",
      "smile, and said bravely, \"I drink-- Health to my Beth!  You are a good\n",
      "doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?\"\n",
      "she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done\n",
      "her troubled mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that\n",
      "will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come\n",
      "at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.\n",
      "Aren't you glad I did it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for\n",
      "he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or\n",
      "harming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the\n",
      "moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms\n",
      "round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \"Oh, Laurie!  Oh,\n",
      "Mother!  I am so glad!\"  She did not weep again, but laughed\n",
      "hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a\n",
      "little bewildered by the sudden news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.\n",
      "He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,\n",
      "followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at\n",
      "once.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying\n",
      "breathlessly, \"Oh, don't!  I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but\n",
      "you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't\n",
      "help flying at you.  Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine\n",
      "again, it makes me act so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind,\" laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.  \"Why, you see I\n",
      "got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.  We thought Hannah was overdoing the\n",
      "authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive\n",
      "us if Beth...  Well, if anything happened, you know.  So I got grandpa\n",
      "to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the\n",
      "office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my\n",
      "head off when I proposed a telegram.  I never can bear to be 'lorded\n",
      "over', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I\n",
      "know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and\n",
      "you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till\n",
      "that blessed lady gets here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, you're an angel!  How shall I ever thank you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fly at me again.  I rather liked it,\" said Laurie, looking\n",
      "mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you.  I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't\n",
      "tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless\n",
      "you, Teddy, bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she\n",
      "vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a\n",
      "dresser and told the assembled cats that she was \"happy, oh, so happy!\"\n",
      "while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do\n",
      "hope Mrs. March is coming right away,\" said Hannah, with an air of\n",
      "relief, when Jo told the good news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set\n",
      "the sickroom in order, and Hannah \"knocked up a couple of pies in case\n",
      "of company unexpected\".  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through\n",
      "the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet\n",
      "rooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth's bird\n",
      "began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's\n",
      "bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,\n",
      "and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as\n",
      "they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, \"Mother's coming,\n",
      "dear! Mother's coming!\"  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that\n",
      "heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It\n",
      "was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once\n",
      "busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and\n",
      "the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the\n",
      "pillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,\n",
      "\"Water!\" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All\n",
      "day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and\n",
      "trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind\n",
      "raged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and\n",
      "every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side\n",
      "of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour\n",
      "brought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,\n",
      "for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which\n",
      "time he would return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell\n",
      "fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling\n",
      "that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance\n",
      "as she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring\n",
      "into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes\n",
      "beautifully soft and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they\n",
      "kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes\n",
      "to us in hours like those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,\" whispered Meg\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,\"\n",
      "answered Jo, with equal fervor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had no heart, it aches so,\" sighed Meg, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get\n",
      "through it,\" added her sister despondently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching\n",
      "Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was\n",
      "still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep\n",
      "hush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale\n",
      "shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and\n",
      "nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.\n",
      "Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the\n",
      "storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at\n",
      "Washington, haunted the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary\n",
      "the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the\n",
      "bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy\n",
      "chair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as\n",
      "she thought, \"Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great\n",
      "change seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of\n",
      "pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful\n",
      "in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.\n",
      "Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp\n",
      "forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \"Good-by, my\n",
      "Beth.  Good-by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to\n",
      "the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and\n",
      "then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,\n",
      "exclaiming, under her breath, \"The fever's turned, she's sleepin'\n",
      "nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy.  Praise be given!  Oh,\n",
      "my goodness me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to\n",
      "confirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite\n",
      "heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, \"Yes,\n",
      "my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time.  Keep\n",
      "the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark\n",
      "hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with\n",
      "hearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and\n",
      "cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,\n",
      "with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and\n",
      "breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mother would only come now!\" said Jo, as the winter night began to\n",
      "wane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See,\" said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \"I thought\n",
      "this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow if she--went\n",
      "away from us.  But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put\n",
      "it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she\n",
      "sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed\n",
      "so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out\n",
      "in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks like a fairy world,\" said Meg, smiling to herself, as she\n",
      "stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hark!\" cried Jo, starting to her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,\n",
      "and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, \"Girls, she's come!\n",
      "She's come!\"\n",

      "AMY'S WILL\n",
      "\n",
      "While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at\n",
      "Aunt March's.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her\n",
      "life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March\n",
      "never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be\n",
      "kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\n",
      "March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,\n",
      "though she didn't think it proper to confess it.  She really did her\n",
      "best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old\n",
      "people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can\n",
      "sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at\n",
      "home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and\n",
      "receiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this\n",
      "gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim\n",
      "ways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable\n",
      "than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,\n",
      "as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So\n",
      "she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught\n",
      "sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made\n",
      "her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\n",
      "spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then\n",
      "she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck\n",
      "escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much\n",
      "carving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the\n",
      "lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or\n",
      "deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big\n",
      "chair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was\n",
      "a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one\n",
      "hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to\n",
      "go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.\n",
      "After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady\n",
      "slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the\n",
      "first page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with\n",
      "outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed\n",
      "to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the\n",
      "worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her\n",
      "youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go\n",
      "to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep\n",
      "before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\n",
      "she never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone\n",
      "was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not\n",
      "admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.\n",
      "He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk\n",
      "to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by\n",
      "pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and\n",
      "behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could\n",
      "not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her\n",
      "when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in\n",
      "the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted\n",
      "something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was\n",
      "bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who\n",
      "ever took any notice of the young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with 'Madame', as she called her\n",
      "mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,\n",
      "who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but\n",
      "Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that\n",
      "she was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to\n",
      "Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in\n",
      "France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces.  She\n",
      "also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious\n",
      "and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient\n",
      "chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy's chief delight was\n",
      "an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and\n",
      "secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some\n",
      "precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and\n",
      "arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel\n",
      "cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had\n",
      "adorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt\n",
      "March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her\n",
      "wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the\n",
      "queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made\n",
      "of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,\n",
      "Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had\n",
      "played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring,\n",
      "too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most\n",
      "precious jewel of them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\" asked Esther,\n",
      "who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm\n",
      "fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I\n",
      "might,\" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold\n",
      "and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a\n",
      "rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,\" said Esther,\n",
      "eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads\n",
      "hanging over your glass?\" asked Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one\n",
      "used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\n",
      "always come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as\n",
      "that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to\n",
      "meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before\n",
      "Madame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much\n",
      "trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it be right for me to do so too?\" asked Amy, who in her\n",
      "loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\n",
      "apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind\n",
      "her of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the\n",
      "little dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,\n",
      "but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good\n",
      "thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an\n",
      "affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.\n",
      "Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next\n",
      "her room, hoping it would do her good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\n",
      "dies,\" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the\n",
      "jewel cases one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I\n",
      "witnessed her will, and it is to be so,\" whispered Esther smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice!  But I wish she'd let us have them now. Procrastination is\n",
      "not agreeable,\" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The\n",
      "first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,\n",
      "and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you\n",
      "when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming\n",
      "manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?  Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\n",
      "ring!  It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.  I do like Aunt\n",
      "March after all.\" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face\n",
      "and a firm resolve to earn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\n",
      "complacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the\n",
      "closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\n",
      "picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no\n",
      "great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\n",
      "Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a\n",
      "very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and\n",
      "Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet\n",
      "face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were\n",
      "busy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and\n",
      "hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought\n",
      "her, and came every day to 'sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and\n",
      "praying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a\n",
      "rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did\n",
      "not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone\n",
      "outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\n",
      "by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\n",
      "Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.\n",
      "She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\n",
      "been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in\n",
      "it confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\n",
      "seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and\n",
      "be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.\n",
      "In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her\n",
      "will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her\n",
      "possessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang\n",
      "even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\n",
      "as precious as the old lady's jewels.\n",
      "\n",
      "During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as\n",
      "well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal\n",
      "terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy\n",
      "felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a\n",
      "second witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse\n",
      "herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for\n",
      "company.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned\n",
      "costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite\n",
      "amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and\n",
      "down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her\n",
      "train about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on\n",
      "this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping\n",
      "in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and\n",
      "tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting\n",
      "oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She\n",
      "was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as\n",
      "Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along\n",
      "in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,\n",
      "imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh\n",
      "or exclaim, \"Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!\n",
      "Kiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\n",
      "should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to\n",
      "consult you about a very serious matter,\" said Amy, when she had shown\n",
      "her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.  \"That bird is the trial\n",
      "of my life,\" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,\n",
      "while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a\n",
      "mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to\n",
      "let him out, and found a big spider there.  I poked it out, and it ran\n",
      "under the bookcase.  Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and\n",
      "peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his\n",
      "eye, 'Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help laughing,\n",
      "which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?\" asked Laurie,\n",
      "yawning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\n",
      "scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! Catch her! Catch\n",
      "her!' as I chased the spider.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a lie!  Oh, lor!\" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\" cried Laurie,\n",
      "shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely\n",
      "croaked, \"Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'm ready,\" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of\n",
      "paper out of her pocket.  \"I want you to read that, please, and tell me\n",
      "if it is legal and right.  I felt I ought to do it, for life is\n",
      "uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,\n",
      "read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\n",
      "spelling:\n",

      "MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT\n",

      "I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all\n",
      "my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\n",
      "\n",
      "To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,\n",

      "my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it),\n",
      "also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for\n",
      "her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her 'little girl'.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my\n",
      "bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious plaster\n",
      "rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau,\n",
      "my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being\n",
      "thin when she gets well.  And I herewith also leave her my regret that\n",
      "I ever made fun of old Joanna.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay\n",
      "portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn't any\n",
      "neck.  Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction\n",
      "any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a\n",
      "looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind\n",
      "him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,\n",
      "especially Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron\n",
      "and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave\n",
      "hoping she 'will remember me, when it you see'.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be\n",
      "satisfied and not blame the dead.  I forgive everyone, and trust we may\n",
      "all meet when the trump shall sound.  Amen.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of\n",

      "The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to\n",
      "rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What put it into your head?  Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving\n",
      "away her things?\" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,\n",
      "with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She explained and then asked anxiously, \"What about Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.  She felt so ill one\n",
      "day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to\n",
      "you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She\n",
      "was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest\n",
      "of us, and her best love to Grandpa.  She never thought of a will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a\n",
      "great tear dropped on the paper.  Amy's face was full of trouble, but\n",
      "she only said, \"Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,\n",
      "sometimes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, 'codicils', they call them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given\n",
      "round to my friends.  I forgot it, but I want it done though it will\n",
      "spoil my looks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\n",
      "amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials.  But\n",
      "when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,\n",
      "\"Is there really any danger about Beth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\n",
      "dear.\"  And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\n",
      "was very comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the\n",
      "twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\n",
      "feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\n",
      "loss of her gentle little sister.\n",

      "I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\n",
      "mother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard\n",
      "to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,\n",
      "merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that\n",
      "Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,\n",
      "healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little\n",
      "rose and Mother's face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only\n",
      "smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the\n",
      "hungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the\n",
      "girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand\n",
      "which clung to hers even in sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah had 'dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,\n",
      "finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg\n",
      "and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened\n",
      "to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to\n",
      "stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the\n",
      "homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had\n",
      "given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay\n",
      "without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So\n",
      "quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,\n",
      "and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\n",
      "mounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted\n",
      "off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like\n",
      "storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would\n",
      "not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to\n",
      "look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some\n",
      "recovered treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\n",
      "that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once said \"I told\n",
      "you so\".  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\n",
      "thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried\n",
      "her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and\n",
      "never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily\n",
      "agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved 'like a capital little\n",
      "woman'.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,\n",
      "blessed her buttons, and begged her to \"come and take a walk, dear\", in\n",
      "his most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy\n",
      "the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping\n",
      "with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she\n",
      "persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her\n",
      "mother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was\n",
      "stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt\n",
      "March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual\n",
      "fit of benignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till\n",
      "night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually\n",
      "roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were\n",
      "a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it\n",
      "is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in\n",
      "her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and\n",
      "compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They\n",
      "were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object\n",
      "when its purpose was explained to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\" looking from the dusty\n",
      "rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its\n",
      "garland of evergreen.  \"It is an excellent plan to have some place\n",
      "where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a\n",
      "good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them\n",
      "if we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning\n",
      "this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\n",
      "closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to\n",
      "make.  The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw,\n",
      "but the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think\n",
      "He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that\n",
      "helps me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs.\n",
      "March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said\n",
      "nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she\n",
      "added gravely, \"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.\n",
      "Aunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and\n",
      "put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to\n",
      "keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as\n",
      "it's too big.  I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\n",
      "ornaments, Amy,\" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,\n",
      "with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint\n",
      "guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try not to be vain,\" said Amy.  \"I don't think I like it only\n",
      "because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\n",
      "wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean Aunt March?\" asked her mother, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, to remind me not to be selfish.\"  Amy looked so earnest and\n",
      "sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened\n",
      "respectfully to the little plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and\n",
      "being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to\n",
      "cure it, if I can.  Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone\n",
      "loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People\n",
      "wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to\n",
      "have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,\n",
      "so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I'm apt to forget my\n",
      "resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I\n",
      "guess I should do better.  May we try this way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your\n",
      "ring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the\n",
      "sincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to\n",
      "Beth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you\n",
      "home again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the\n",
      "traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and\n",
      "finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her\n",
      "fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, deary?\" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a\n",

      "eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight\n",
      "in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it\n",
      "happened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so\n",
      "devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.  He\n",
      "was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved\n",
      "her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry\n",
      "him.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the\n",
      "right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief\n",

      "\n",
      "This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, \"Jo,\n",

      "and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!  They'll go lovering\n",
      "around the house, and we shall have to dodge.  Meg will be absorbed and\n",
      "no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry\n",
      "her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and\n",

      "earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.  I am\n",
      "content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and\n",

      "Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\n",
      "and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg\n",
      "observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had\n",
      "learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so\n",
      "she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was\n",
      "rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo\n",
      "assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn\n",
      "assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.\n",
      "This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as\n",
      "nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\n",
      "confinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as\n",
      "she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was\n",
      "an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\n",
      "mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\n",
      "it.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\n",
      "indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\n",
      "knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,\n",
      "he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling\n",
      "indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\n",
      "wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in\n",
      "preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change\n",
      "seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\n",
      "herself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\n",
      "quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her\n",
      "face.  To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well,\n",
      "and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast.\n",
      "She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,\n",

      "gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as red\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "don't know anything about it, as true as I live!\" said Jo, so earnestly\n",
      "that they believed her.  \"If I had taken part in it I'd have done it\n",
      "better than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think\n",
      "you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,\" she\n",
      "added, scornfully tossing down the paper.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,\n",

      "first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\n",
      "few days.  I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I\n",
      "was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\n",
      "things to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.  I\n",
      "never can look him in the face again.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "said decidedly, \"I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That will do, Jo.  I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\n",

      "Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\n",

      "silence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie's step\n",
      "was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\n",
      "the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\n",
      "wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\n",
      "stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\n",
      "Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\n",
      "sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of\n",
      "voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened\n",
      "during that interview the girls never knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such\n",
      "a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\n",

      "out-and-out sorry I am,\" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think\n",
      "you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\" replied Meg, trying to hide\n",
      "her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for\n",
      "a month, but you will, though, won't you?\" And Laurie folded his hands\n",
      "together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his\n",
      "irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him\n",
      "in spite of his scandalous behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her\n",

      "no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\n",

      "As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and\n",
      "not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow and hard\n",
      "to manage,\" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if\n",

      "\n",
      "Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\n",

      "\n",

      "much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a\n",
      "troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his\n",
      "table.  It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, and\n",
      "married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered\n",
      "and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?  Where's your respect for\n",
      "me, and your proper bringing up?  Bless the boys and girls!  What\n",

      "down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\n",
      "absurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\n",
      "bring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is\n",
      "better than talking.  I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\n",

      "Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,\n",
      "decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door\n",
      "locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly\n",

      "\"Of course I am!\" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first\n",
      "silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. \"How can I be\n",
      "otherwise?\" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her\n",
      "husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed the\n",
      "brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the\n",

      "Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the\n",
      "delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.  Half an hour\n",
      "after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one\n",
      "drop more, the drop came.  Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his\n",
      "head in very quietly.  He might just as well have turned a somersault\n",
      "and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed\n",
      "excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped\n",
      "up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \"Here's another\n",
      "Christmas present for the March family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away\n",
      "somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,\n",
      "leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and\n",
      "couldn't.  Of course there was a general stampede, and for several\n",
      "minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\n",
      "were done, and no one said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.\n",
      "Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by\n",
      "Laurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,\n",
      "as he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled\n",
      "over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her\n",
      "father's boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first\n",
      "to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, \"Hush!\n",
      "Remember Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper\n",
      "appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and\n",
      "Beth ran straight into her father's arms.  Never mind what happened\n",
      "just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the\n",
      "bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\n",
      "again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\n",
      "turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\n",
      "kitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke\n",
      "for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\n",
      "remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he\n",
      "precipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\n",
      "which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\n",
      "fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\n",
      "of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\n",
      "estimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just\n",
      "there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\n",
      "looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\n",
      "to imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,\n",
      "rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat.  Jo saw\n",
      "and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\n",
      "beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, \"I hate\n",
      "estimable young men with brown eyes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat\n",
      "turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,\n",
      "browned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's\n",
      "mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a\n",
      "honeypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\n",
      "\"For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\n",

      "of it in a cloth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom\n",
      "Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs\n",
      "stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\n",
      "father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank\n",
      "healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced', as the old folks say,\n",
      "and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the\n",
      "girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and\n",
      "as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\n",
      "to have.  Do you remember?\" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\n",
      "followed a long conversation about many things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!\" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\n",
      "and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's been a pretty hard one,\" observed Amy, watching the light\n",
      "shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,\" whispered Beth, who\n",
      "sat on her father's knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\n",
      "the latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the\n",
      "burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\" said Mr. March,\n",
      "looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\n",
      "round him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?\" asked Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several\n",
      "discoveries today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, tell us what they are!\" cried Meg, who sat beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is one.\" And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his\n",
      "chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and\n",
      "two or three little hard spots on the palm.  \"I remember a time when\n",
      "this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.\n",
      "It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this\n",
      "seeming blemishes I read a little history.  A burnt offering has been\n",
      "made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than\n",
      "blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will\n",
      "last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my\n",
      "dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white\n",
      "hands or fashionable accomplishments.  I'm proud to shake this good,\n",
      "industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it\n",
      "away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\n",
      "in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\n",
      "gave her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about Jo?  Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard\n",
      "and been so very, very good to me,\" said Beth in her father's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\n",
      "unusually mild expression in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a\n",
      "year ago,\" said Mr. March.  \"I see a young lady who pins her collar\n",
      "straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,\n",
      "nor lies on the rug as she used to do.  Her face is rather thin and\n",
      "pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for\n",
      "it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn't bounce, but\n",
      "moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly\n",
      "way which delights me.  I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a\n",
      "strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite\n",
      "satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,\n",
      "but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful\n",
      "enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew\n",
      "rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, feeling that\n",
      "she did deserve a portion of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Beth,\" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\n",
      "slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\"\n",
      "began their father cheerfully.  But recollecting how nearly he had lost\n",
      "her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his\n",
      "own, \"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\n",
      "at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her\n",
      "mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on\n",
      "every one with patience and good humor.  I also observe that she does\n",
      "not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\n",
      "pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to\n",
      "think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try\n",
      "and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay\n",
      "figures.  I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a\n",
      "graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable\n",
      "daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of, Beth?\" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\n",
      "father and told about her ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I read in _Pilgrim's Progress_ today how, after many troubles,\n",
      "Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies\n",
      "bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\n",
      "before they went on to their journey's end,\" answered Beth, adding, as\n",
      "she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, \"It's\n",
      "singing time now, and I want to be in my old place.  I'll try to sing\n",
      "the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard.  I made the\n",
      "music for Father, because he likes the verses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and\n",
      "in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her\n",
      "own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song\n",
      "for her.\n",

      "\n",
      "Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered\n",
      "about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait\n",
      "upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed\n",
      "by kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with\n",
      "the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then\n",
      "'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their\n",
      "happiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,\n",
      "though none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one\n",
      "another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had\n",
      "sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's\n",
      "umbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,\n",
      "and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name\n",
      "was mentioned.  Amy said, \"Everyone seemed waiting for something, and\n",
      "couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,\"\n",
      "and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as\n",
      "usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed\n",
      "suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one\n",
      "knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\n",
      "imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave\n",
      "himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\n",
      "and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does the goose mean?\" said Meg, laughing and trying to look\n",
      "unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't\n",
      "it?\" answered Jo scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,\" but Meg's voice lingered\n",
      "over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  \"Please don't\n",
      "plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there\n",
      "isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as\n",
      "before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has\n",
      "spoiled you for me.  I see it, and so does Mother.  You are not like\n",
      "your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.  I don't mean\n",
      "to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\n",
      "settled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\n",
      "have it over quickly,\" said Jo pettishly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said\n",
      "I was too young,\" began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little\n",
      "smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on\n",
      "that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or\n",

      "no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should\n",
      "say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares.  There's\n",
      "no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had\n",
      "unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color\n",
      "varying in her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?\" asked Jo more respectfully.\n",
      "\n",

      "and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own\n",
      "affairs of this sort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't mean to have any.  It's fun to watch other people philander, but\n",
      "I should feel like a fool doing it myself,\" said Jo, looking alarmed at\n",
      "the thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.\"  Meg\n",
      "spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often\n",
      "seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\" said Jo,\n",
      "rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young\n",
      "to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let\n",
      "us be friends as we were.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!  I don't believe you'll ever say\n",
      "it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the\n",
      "rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\n",
      "feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I won't.  I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk\n",
      "out of the room with dignity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\n",
      "exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to\n",
      "sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam\n",
      "in a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when\n",
      "someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was\n",
      "anything but hospitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your\n",
      "father finds himself today,\" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\n",
      "as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very well, he's in the rack.  I'll get him, and tell it you are\n",
      "here.\"  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in\n",
      "her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her\n",
      "speech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\n",
      "sidle toward the door, murmuring...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I'll call her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?\" and Mr. Brooke looked so\n",
      "hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She\n",
      "blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\n",
      "her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and\n",
      "sweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at\n",
      "her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\n",
      "gratefully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish\n",
      "I could thank you for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell you how?\" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast\n",
      "in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\n",
      "eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\n",
      "and to stop and listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,\" she said, trying to withdraw her\n",
      "hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,\n",
      "Meg.  I love you so much, dear,\" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make\n",
      "it.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \"I don't\n",
      "know,\" so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\n",
      "little reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself\n",
      "as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in\n",
      "his most persuasive tone, \"Will you try and find out?  I want to know\n",
      "so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I\n",
      "am to have my reward in the end or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm too young,\" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\n",
      "rather enjoying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.\n",
      "Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than\n",
      "German,\" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that\n",
      "she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg\n",

      "and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\n",

      "excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\n",

      "tramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so\n",
      "wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of\n",

      "\n",
      "The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had\n",

      "drove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back\n",
      "part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to\n",
      "surprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started\n",
      "as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me, what's all this?\" cried the old lady with a rap of her cane\n",

      "Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\n",
      "going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\" with another rap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\" began Meg,\n",
      "wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brooke?  That boy's tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about\n",
      "it.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters,\n",
      "and I made her tell me.  You haven't gone and accepted him, child?\"\n",
      "cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! He'll hear.  Shan't I call Mother?\" said Meg, much troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.  I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at\n",
      "once.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one\n",

      "\n",
      "Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\n",
      "opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of\n",
      "us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and\n",
      "in love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\n",
      "probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was\n",
      "preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind\n",
      "that she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\n",
      "easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\n",
      "unusual spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\n",
      "to anyone you like,\" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be\n",

      "brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to\n",
      "love him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and\n",
      "after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she\n",
      "could, \"Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it\n",
      "kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake\n",
      "at the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It's\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \"This Rook is\n",

      "\"No, but he has many warm friends.\"\n",

      "left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\n",
      "Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, who said all in one breath, \"I couldn't help hearing, Meg.\n",

      "for me a little bit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know how much till she abused you,\" began Meg.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the\n",

      "and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\n",
      "objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid\n",
      "enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister\n",
      "enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject\n",
      "submission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had\n",
      "suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables\n",
      "actually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and\n",
      "saw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as\n",

      "\n",
      "That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and\n",
      "making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\n",

      "tragically as she burst into the room, \"Oh, do somebody go down quick!\n",
      "John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon\n",

      "agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,\n",

      "to the rats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great\n",
      "deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends\n",
      "by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his\n",
      "plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\n",
      "he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\n",
      "looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\n",
      "was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth\n",
      "beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\n",
      "young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly\n",
      "evident Aunt March was right in calling them as 'unworldly as a pair of\n",
      "babies'.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old\n",
      "room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the\n",
      "family began there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure I can't.  How much has happened since I said that! It\n",
      "seems a year ago,\" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far\n",
      "above such common things as bread and butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the\n",
      "changes have begun,\" said Mrs. March.  \"In most families there comes,\n",
      "now and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it\n",
      "ends well, after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hope the next will end better,\" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to\n",
      "see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few\n",
      "persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or\n",
      "lessened in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if\n",
      "I live to work out my plans,\" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if\n",
      "everything had become possible to him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?\" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for\n",
      "the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short\n",
      "time to me,\" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen\n",
      "there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have only to wait, I am to do the work,\" said John beginning his\n",
      "labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo\n",
      "to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the\n",
      "front door banged, \"Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible\n",
      "conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good\n",
      "spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for 'Mrs. John Brooke',\n",
      "and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had\n",
      "been brought about by his excellent management.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when\n",
      "he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky\n",
      "falls,\" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\n",
      "congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for\n",
      "the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\" answered Mr.\n",
      "Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face\n",
      "alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look\n",
      "festive, ma'am, what's the matter?\" asked Laurie, following her into a\n",
      "corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and\n",
      "shall not say a word against it,\" said Jo solemnly.  \"You can't know\n",
      "how hard it is for me to give up Meg,\" she continued with a little\n",
      "quiver in her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't give her up.  You only go halves,\" said Laurie consolingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can never be the same again.  I've lost my dearest friend,\" sighed\n",
      "Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've got me, anyhow.  I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand\n",
      "by you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!\" and Laurie\n",
      "meant what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.  You are always a great\n",
      "comfort to me, Teddy,\" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.  It's all right you\n",
      "see.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,\n",
      "Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\n",
      "own little house.  We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I\n",
      "shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some\n",
      "nice trip or other.  Wouldn't that console you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in\n",
      "three years,\" said Jo thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true.  Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see\n",
      "where we shall all be then?  I do,\" returned Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so\n",
      "happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved.\" And Jo's eyes\n",
      "went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the\n",
      "prospect was a pleasant one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of\n",
      "the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing\n",
      "the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\n",
      "of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\n",

      "held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\n",
      "him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\n",

      "leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\n",

      "the big one.  It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave\n",
      "themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I\n",

      "begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will\n",

      "\"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,\" said Meg, listening respectfully to\n",

      "absorbing subject of house keeping.  \"Do you know I like this room most\n",
      "of all in my baby house,\" added Meg, a minute after, as they went\n",
      "upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and\n",
      "exulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for\n",

      "rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her\n",
      "repent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in\n",
      "her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she\n",
      "could satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to\n",
      "buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,\n",
      "and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the\n",
      "secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt\n",
      "March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could\n",
      "give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first\n",
      "bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young\n",

      "fineness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me\n",

      "might.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt\n",
      "basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a\n",
      "great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the\n",

      "attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and\n",
      "everyone began to talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is John?\" asked Meg anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ours, of course.  Wish you'd been there to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is the lovely Miss Randal?\" asked Amy with a significant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More cruel than ever.  Don't you see how I'm pining away?\" and Laurie\n",
      "gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,\" said Beth, eying\n",
      "the knobby parcel with curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,\"\n",
      "observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of\n",
      "the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just\n",
      "swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood\n",
      "in a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn't it?\" and Laurie gave them a sample of\n",
      "its powers that made them cover up their ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to\n",
      "mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from\n",
      "destruction.  I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\n",
      "hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\n",
      "like a remarkably plummy one.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.  I'm in such a state of exhaustion I\n",

      "do, it's peculiarly becoming,\" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\n",
      "aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his\n",
      "feeble steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,\" began Jo,\n",
      "as they strolled away together.  \"You must promise to behave well, and\n",

      "certainly laugh if you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round\n",
      "you will obscure the prospect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never cry unless for some great affliction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such as fellows going to college, hey?\" cut in Laurie, with suggestive\n",
      "laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be a peacock.  I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly.  I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?  Pretty amiable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very.  Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say 'All\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't.\"\n",

      "\"Then don't go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,\" said\n",

      "\"You spend a great deal, Teddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone\n",

      "\n",

      "Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,\n",
      "that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only\n",

      "like friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with\n",
      "excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,\n",
      "whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the\n",
      "dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod\n",

      "welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,\n",
      "and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest\n",
      "baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle\n",
      "mistress who had loved and tended them so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest\n",
      "in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it\n",
      "fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,\n",
      "lace, nor orange flowers would she have.  \"I don't want a fashionable\n",
      "wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to\n",
      "look and be my familiar self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\n",
      "and innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her\n",
      "pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\n",
      "valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\n",

      "changed the old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few\n",
      "minutes with Father quietly in the study,\"  and Meg ran down to perform\n",
      "these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\n",
      "went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\n",
      "was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the\n",
      "first bird from the nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\n",
      "simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\n",
      "three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their\n",
      "best just now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with\n",
      "ease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\n",
      "more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a\n",
      "fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\n",
      "gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,\n",
      "kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\n",
      "although it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches\n",
      "the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains\n",
      "and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at sixteen\n",
      "she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but\n",
      "possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\n",
      "lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\n",
      "dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as\n",
      "attractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy's nose still afflicted her,\n",
      "for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and\n",
      "having a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her\n",
      "whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\n",
      "wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and\n",
      "abundant than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the\n",
      "summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just\n",

      "their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the\n",
      "romance of womanhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as\n",

      "to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and\n",
      "to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a\n",
      "grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, here's a state of things!\" cried the old lady, taking\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Brooke didn't even say, \"Thank you,\" but as he stooped for the\n",

      "with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with\n",
      "a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\n",
      "exclamation, \"Jupiter Ammon!  Jo's upset the cake again!\" caused a\n",
      "momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins\n",
      "arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant\n",
      "if he likes,\" returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware\n",
      "of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a\n",
      "devotion that nearly distracted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room\n",
      "as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green\n",
      "arch.  Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.\n",
      "The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the\n",
      "service more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom's hand trembled\n",
      "visibly, and no one heard his replies.  But Meg looked straight up in\n",
      "her husband's eyes, and said, \"I will!\" with such tender trust in her\n",
      "own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March\n",
      "sniffed audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved\n",
      "from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring\n",
      "fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his\n",
      "wicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\n",
      "but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\n",
      "sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\n",
      "married, Meg cried, \"The first kiss for Marmee!\" and turning, gave it\n",
      "with her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked\n",
      "more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their\n",
      "privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\n",
      "adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\n",
      "in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, \"Bless you, deary, a\n",
      "hundred times!  The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks\n",
      "lovely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\n",
      "to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are\n",
      "light.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the\n",
      "little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful\n",
      "lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt\n",
      "March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and\n",
      "coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes\n",
      "carried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on\n",
      "serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his\n",
      "hand and a puzzled expression on his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?\" he whispered, \"or am I\n",
      "merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\n",
      "morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March\n",
      "actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and\n",
      "dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.  You know he thinks that\n",
      "wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she\n",
      "nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he\n",
      "did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\n",
      "way, \"I like that!  For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women\n",
      "would think as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?\" and there was an anxious\n",
      "accent in Meg's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  I give you my word for it.  Don't think too well of me, either,\n",
      "this is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as\n",
      "common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a\n",
      "pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\n",
      "Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\n",
      "day of my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\n",
      "for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\n",
      "he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her\n",
      "power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,\n",
      "but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\n",
      "and a smile which said, \"No one can refuse me anything today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her\n",
      "his hand, saying heartily, \"I promise, Mrs. Brooke!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you, very, very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy,\" cried Jo,\n",
      "baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and\n",
      "beamed approvingly upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of\n",
      "many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy\n",

      "After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the\n",
      "house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and\n",
      "John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,\n",
      "when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing\n",
      "touch to this unfashionable wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\n",
      "and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\n",
      "couples outside!\" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,\n",
      "with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their\n",
      "example without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol\n",
      "began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a\n",
      "moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into\n",
      "the ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for\n",
      "when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,\n",
      "she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join\n",
      "hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young\n",
      "folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\n",
      "began to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll\n",
      "be sorry for it,\" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\n",
      "he led her to the carriage, \"You've got a treasure, young man, see that\n",
      "you deserve it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I\n",
      "don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,\" observed Mrs.\n",
      "Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.\n",

      "\"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\n",
      "one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\n",
      "satisfied,\" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to\n",
      "rest after the excitement of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,\" was Laurie's unusually dutiful\n",
      "reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had\n",
      "was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she\n",
      "came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and\n",
      "straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say\n",
      "'good-by', as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love\n",
      "you any the less for loving John so much,\" she said, clinging to her\n",
      "mother, with full eyes for a moment.  \"I shall come every day, Father,\n",
      "and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am\n",
      "married.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls\n",
      "will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank\n",
      "you all for my happy wedding day.  Good-by, good-by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender\n",
      "pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands\n",

      "It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and\n",
      "genius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning\n",
      "this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for\n",
      "inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\n",
      "For a long time there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she\n",
      "devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\n",
      "such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\n",

      "\"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\n",
      "turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a\n",

      "truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and\n",
      "rides in a coupe,\" said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!\"\n",

      "arose. \"The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great\n",
      "deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you\n",
      "call fashionable nonsense.  You don't care to make people like you, to\n",
      "go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and\n",
      "I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through\n",
      "the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\n",
      "independence, if you like.  That's not my way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the\n",
      "best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,\n",
      "while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to\n",
      "such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an\n",
      "argument.  Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a\n",
      "good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more\n",
      "amiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to\n",
      "sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she\n",
      "regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.\n",

      "Monday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor\n",
      "because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that \"ef the\n",
      "washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well\n",
      "anywheres\".  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had\n",
      "a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was 'Nil\n",
      "desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to\n",
      "do it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah's cooking\n",
      "didn't turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and\n",
      "the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more\n",
      "than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which\n",
      "seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.\n",
      "Beth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of\n",
      "callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind\n",
      "that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,\n",
      "serious, and trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,\n",
      "an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On\n",
      "Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more\n",
      "exasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,\n",
      "blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for\n",
      "anyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out\n",
      "of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got\n",
      "in order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but\n",
      "without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the\n",
      "best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\n",
      "carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave\n",
      "an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo\n",
      "scattered about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\n",
      "it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\n",
      "would get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and\n",
      "Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah\n",
      "behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an\n",
      "absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of\n",
      "everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy\n",
      "cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch\n",
      "safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of\n",
      "artistic delights, for the 'cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were\n",
      "her strong points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\n",
      "to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart\n",
      "shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\n",
      "ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the\n",
      "exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\n",
      "perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must\n",
      "fly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\n",
      "morning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\n",
      "said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting\n",
      "a little stale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,\"\n",
      "said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\n",
      "placid despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,\" advised\n",
      "his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at\n",
      "it.  I'm very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of\n",
      "cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,\" said Amy\n",
      "decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\n",
      "of a martyr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to\n",
      "try me.  I'll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\n",
      "fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she\n",
      "departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and\n",
      "fit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her\n",
      "desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further\n",
      "loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her\n",
      "own forethought.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\n",
      "Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\n",
      "find out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her\n",
      "card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,\n",
      "who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\n",
      "\"Good morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\n",
      "most elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out\n",
      "before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and\n",
      "congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,\n",
      "returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\n",
      "learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting\n",
      "away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In\n",
      "stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the\n",
      "lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the\n",
      "highborn eyes of a Tudor!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\n",
      "poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\n",
      "to hand out the basket after the old lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't--it's--it's mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as\n",
      "red as her fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?\"\n",
      "said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest\n",
      "that did credit to his breeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\n",
      "and said, laughing, \"Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad\n",
      "he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind\n",
      "were touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of\n",
      "pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the charming young ladies'\n",
      "diverted his mind from the comical mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see\n",
      "them, that's a comfort,\" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,\n",
      "thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of\n",
      "dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the\n",
      "preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve\n",
      "o'clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were\n",
      "interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of\n",
      "yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the\n",
      "'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests\n",
      "to the banquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the rumble, they're coming!  I'll go onto the porch and meet\n",
      "them.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good\n",
      "time after all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the\n",
      "word.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable\n",
      "expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one\n",
      "young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It\n",
      "will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\"\n",
      "cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even\n",
      "for a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who\n",
      "had kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic\n",
      "turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a\n",
      "most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the\n",
      "merriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily\n",
      "partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with\n",
      "enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),\n",
      "and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when\n",
      "'the party went out'.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she\n",
      "observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,\n",
      "except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\n",
      "as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\n",
      "thought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so\n",
      "much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,\" asked\n",
      "Meg soberly.\n",
      "\n",

      "contenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her\n",
      "experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave\n",
      "her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and\n",
      "costumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\n",
      "limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\n",
      "make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\n",
      "earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript\n",

      "dollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had\n",

      "devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo\n",

      "came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her\n",
      "that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the\n",

      "while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was\n",
      "satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\n",
      "a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\n",
      "did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\n",
      "house, for by the magic of a pen, her 'rubbish' turned into comforts\n",
      "for them all.  The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom\n",

      "side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine\n",
      "satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the\n",
      "inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful\n",
      "blessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and\n",
      "ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that\n",
      "she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and\n",
      "encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame\n",
      "and fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to\n",
      "all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling\n",
      "to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she\n",
      "would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she\n",
      "particularly admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for\n",
      "printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can\n",
      "for it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is\n",
      "more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\n",
      "and the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,\" was her\n",
      "father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited\n",
      "patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\n",
      "haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by\n",
      "waiting,\" said Mrs. March.  \"Criticism is the best test of such work,\n",
      "for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her\n",
      "to do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame\n",
      "of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Jo, knitting her brows, \"that's just it.  I've been fussing\n",
      "over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or\n",
      "indifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\n",
      "take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't leave a word out of it.  You'll spoil it if you do, for the\n",

      "\"Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a\n",
      "good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when\n",
      "you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical\n",
      "and metaphysical people in your novels,\" said Amy, who took a strictly\n",
      "practical view of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Jo, laughing, \"if my people are 'philosophical and\n",
      "metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\n",
      "except what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I've got some of his wise\n",
      "ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,\n",
      "Beth, what do you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should so like to see it printed soon,\" was all Beth said, and\n",
      "smiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\n",
      "word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\n",
      "candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,\n",
      "and decided her to make her little venture 'soon'.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\n",
      "her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of\n",
      "pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and\n",
      "his donkey in the fable suited nobody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\n",
      "into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about\n",
      "it.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.\n",
      "Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.\n",
      "Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while\n",
      "Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo\n",
      "quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the\n",
      "story.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and\n",
      "confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into\n",
      "the big, busy world to try its fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,\n",
      "likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she\n",

      "it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a\n",
      "promising book or broken all the ten commandments?\" cried poor Jo,\n",
      "turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with\n",
      "pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  \"This man says,\n",

      "spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no\n",
      "theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my\n",
      "characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.\n",
      "Another says, 'It's one of the best American novels which has appeared\n",
      "for years.' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that\n",

      "\n",

      "and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced\n",
      "'charmingly natural, tender, and true'.  So I'll comfort myself with\n",

      "\n",
      "While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's\n",

      "to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be\n",
      "privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be\n",
      "concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little\n",
      "Hummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced\n",
      "a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would\n",
      "ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread\n",
      "pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although\n",
      "he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was\n",
      "found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young\n",

      "Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with\n",
      "homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\n",
      "was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra\n",
      "quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be\n",
      "attended to at once.  As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal\n",
      "to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that\n",
      "she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\n",
      "pleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little\n",
      "pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\n",
      "her.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\n",
      "elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\n",
      "bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\n",
      "success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array\n",
      "of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\n",
      "the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\n",
      "resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\n",
      "straining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked\n",
      "advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\n",
      "did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but\n",
      "that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,\n",
      "but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with\n",
      "their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over\n",
      "that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,\n",
      "but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on\n",
      "without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had\n",
      "advised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats\n",
      "all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her\n",
      "topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and\n",
      "wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, \"My\n",

      "\n",
      "How charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to\n",

      "superior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,\n",
      "it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an\n",
      "opportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in\n",

      "come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\n",
      "through and have a good time yet.  Don't cry, dear, but just exert\n",
      "yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We're both as hungry\n",
      "as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and\n",
      "bread and cheese.  We won't ask for jelly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I'm too used up\n",
      "to 'exert' myself for anyone.  It's like a man to propose a bone and\n",
      "vulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won't have anything of the sort\n",
      "in my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him I'm away,\n",
      "sick, dead, anything.  I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and\n",
      "my jelly as much as you like.  You won't have anything else here.\"  and\n",
      "having delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her\n",

      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.\n",

      "they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous\n",
      "lunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten\n",
      "\"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\n",
      "sweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "short-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\n",

      "dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\n",
      "forgiven.\n",

      "Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.\n",

      "wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his\n",
      "friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but\n",
      "John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had\n",
      "deserted him in his hour of need.  \"It wasn't fair to tell a man to\n",

      "at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to\n",
      "be laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over\n",
      "and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over\n",
      "him.  \"Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so\n",
      "heartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was\n",
      "young.  I must be patient and teach her.\"  He hoped she had not gone\n",
      "home--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled\n",
      "again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry\n",
      "herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\n",
      "resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\n",
      "she had failed in her duty to her spouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show him his\n",
      "duty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and\n",
      "comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of\n",
      "the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\n",
      "as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\n",
      "\n",
      "John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling\n",
      "that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\n",
      "leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly\n",
      "relevant remark, \"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no objection,\" was Meg's equally soothing remark.  A few other\n",
      "topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and\n",
      "wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went\n",
      "to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\n",
      "figuratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if\n",
      "new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\n",
      "spoke.  Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt desperately\n",
      "uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear,\" thought Meg, \"married life is very trying, and does need\n",
      "infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.\"  The word 'Mother'\n",
      "suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with\n",
      "unbelieving protests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\n",
      "and bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but\n",
      "never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.\n",
      "He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,\n",
      "though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,\n",
      "and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.\n",
      "He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the\n",
      "white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to\n",
      "quench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against\n",
      "yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch\n",
      "yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\n",
      "the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\n",
      "the way for bitter sorrow and regret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\n",
      "especially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own\n",
      "hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\n",
      "own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\n",
      "such a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in\n",
      "her eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,\n",
      "thinking, \"I will be the first to say, 'Forgive me'\", but he did not\n",
      "seem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was\n",
      "hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a\n",
      "minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought,\n",
      "\"This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\n",
      "myself with,\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\n",
      "forehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than\n",
      "a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\n",
      "tenderly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,\n",
      "dear.  I never will again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\n",
      "declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family\n",
      "peace was preserved in that little family jar.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\n",
      "served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\n",
      "course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\n",
      "everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a\n",
      "lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all\n",
      "the way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat\n",
      "renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\n",
      "the little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in and spend the\n",
      "day at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\n",
      "felt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and\n",
      "nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell\n",
      "out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.\n",
      "Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself\n",
      "because she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered\n",
      "her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John\n",
      "wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what\n",
      "John disliked even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\n",
      "her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\n",
      "more--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she\n",
      "liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every\n",
      "penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's\n",
      "wife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her\n",
      "little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without\n",
      "fear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted\n",
      "her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg\n",
      "didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but\n",
      "she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console\n",
      "herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she\n",
      "had to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty\n",
      "things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't\n",
      "worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in\n",
      "the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up\n",
      "her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.\n",
      "John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he\n",
      "was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\n",
      "never forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and\n",
      "it weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\n",
      "longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black\n",
      "silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\n",
      "for girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of\n",
      "twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.  That was only a month to\n",
      "wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had\n",
      "the money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his\n",
      "was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective\n",
      "five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?\n",
      "That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to\n",
      "lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg\n",
      "beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,\n",
      "shimmering folds, and said, \"A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.\" She\n",
      "answered, \"I'll take it,\" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie\n",
      "had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no\n",
      "consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,\n",
      "and the police were after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\n",

      "were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was\n",
      "undoing the old pocketbook which they called the 'bank', when Meg,\n",

      "wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning\n",
      "of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three\n",
      "rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a\n",
      "bonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like\n",
      "the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\n",

      "the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\n",

      "so.  I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and\n",
      "pitying me because I don't.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and\n",

      "The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\n",
      "he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\n",

      "minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,\n",
      "saying with a little quiver in his voice, \"I was afraid of this.  I do\n",
      "my best, Meg.\"  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\n",

      "promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had\n",
      "reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings\n",
      "recklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so\n",
      "quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he\n",
      "stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry\n",
      "herself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the\n",
      "discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat\n",
      "reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had\n",
      "simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \"I\n",
      "can't afford it, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with\n",
      "her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would\n",
      "break.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\n",
      "better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\n",
      "given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\n",
      "a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\n",
      "and failures of those he loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\n",
      "truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.\n",
      "Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\n",
      "of it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and\n",
      "when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\n",
      "silk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\n",
      "present, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home\n",
      "early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning\n",
      "by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted\n",
      "little wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,\" she said invitingly.\n",

      "Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twins, by Jupiter!\" was all he said for a minute, then turning to the\n",

      "looking at a pair of infantile kittens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boy and girl.  Aren't they beauties?\" said the proud papa, beaming\n",
      "upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\n",
      "\n",

      "to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\n",
      "calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\n",

      "put the pink rose in your bonnet.  It's becoming, and you look too\n",
      "sober in your plain suit.  Take your light gloves and the embroidered\n",

      "put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out\n",

      "can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can't, but it's very nice to\n",

      "simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.\n",
      "Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress\n",

      "ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and\n",
      "join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that an original idea?\" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\n",
      "nothing the child can't do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\n",

      "shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,\"\n",

      "who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any mention of her 'works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\n",
      "grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque\n",
      "remark, as now.  \"Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write\n",

      "going to New York this winter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly\n",
      "grateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,\n",
      "but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\n",
      "for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\n",
      "abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\n",
      "mouths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining\n",

      "come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I do well?\" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing could have been worse,\" was Amy's crushing reply. \"What\n",
      "possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\n",
      "boots, and all the rest of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's funny, and amuses people.  They know we are poor, so it's no\n",

      "and have things as easy and fine as they do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\n",

      "pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to\n",
      "speak,\" said Amy despairingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with\n",
      "the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How shall I behave here?\" she asked, as they approached the third\n",
      "mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,\" was Amy's short answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we'll have a\n",
      "comfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\n",
      "has a bad effect upon my constitution,\" returned Jo gruffly, being\n",
      "disturbed by her failure to suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\n",
      "speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the\n",
      "hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\n",
      "herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She\n",
      "listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\n",
      "poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that \"Tom Brown was a brick,\"\n",
      "regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a\n",
      "visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma\n",
      "to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\n",
      "in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and\n",
      "dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an\n",
      "inspired Frenchwoman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself\n",
      "to her heart's content.  Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady\n",
      "who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole\n",
      "family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and\n",
      "breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best\n",
      "of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which\n",
      "set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming\n",
      "of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\n",
      "something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like\n",
      "that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while\n",
      "she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.\n",
      "But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\n",
      "British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the\n",
      "proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\n",
      "this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\n",
      "that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\n",
      "should bring disgrace upon the name of March.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the\n",
      "grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\n",
      "reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\n",
      "one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was\n",
      "poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\n",
      "gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\n",
      "gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her\n",
      "damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\n",
      "again, \"It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Capital boys, aren't they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after\n",
      "that.\" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\n",
      "habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?\" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\n",
      "any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his\n",
      "father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he\n",
      "is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let\n",
      "him alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and\n",
      "just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\n",
      "whose father keeps a grocery store.  If you had just reversed the nod\n",
      "and the bow, it would have been right,\" said Amy reprovingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it wouldn't,\" returned Jo, \"I neither like, respect, nor admire\n",
      "Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third\n",
      "cousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.\n",
      "I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman\n",
      "in spite of the brown paper parcels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's no use trying to argue with you,\" began Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the least, my dear,\" interrupted Jo, \"so let us look amiable, and\n",
      "drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\n",
      "grateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo\n",
      "uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being\n",
      "told that the young ladies were engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.  We can run down\n",
      "there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our\n",
      "best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak for yourself, if you please.  Aunt March likes to have us pay\n",
      "her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It's a\n",
      "little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it\n",
      "will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping\n",
      "boys spoil them.  Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your\n",
      "bonnet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a good girl you are, Amy!\" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\n",
      "her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\n",
      "spotless still.  \"I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\n",
      "please people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much\n",
      "time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and\n",
      "let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,\n",
      "\"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they\n",
      "have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd\n",
      "remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am,\n",
      "because there is more of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own\n",
      "that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life for a\n",
      "person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it.  It's a\n",
      "great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a greater not to be able to hide them.  I don't mind saying that\n",
      "I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not called upon\n",
      "to tell him so.  Neither are you, and there is no use in making\n",
      "yourself disagreeable because he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and\n",
      "how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any\n",
      "good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to manage.  But\n",
      "there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word,\n",
      "and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other\n",
      "boys,\" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have\n",
      "convulsed the 'remarkable boy' if he had heard it.  \"If we were belles,\n",
      "or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but\n",
      "for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve\n",
      "of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a\n",
      "particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and\n",
      "puritanical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely\n",
      "because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort\n",
      "of morality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world,\n",
      "and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their\n",
      "pains.  I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the\n",
      "laughing the world would never get on without them.  We can't agree\n",
      "about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will\n",
      "get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should\n",
      "rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some\n",
      "particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her.  It's\n",
      "my doom, and I can't help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very\n",
      "interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a\n",
      "conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their\n",
      "nieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but\n",
      "Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased\n",
      "everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit\n",
      "was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared' her affectionately,\n",
      "looking what they afterward said emphatically, \"That child improves\n",
      "every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy\n",
      "sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well\n",
      "in the young.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Aunt.  Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a\n",
      "table, as I have nothing but my time to give.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not,\" put in Jo decidedly.  \"I hate to be patronized, and the\n",
      "Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly\n",
      "connected fair.  I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to\n",
      "work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am willing to work.  It's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,\n",
      "and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.\n",
      "Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It's a\n",
      "pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and\n",
      "that is trying,\" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at\n",
      "Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance\n",
      "for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but\n",
      "unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see\n",
      "what goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot\n",
      "as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a\n",
      "saving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of\n",
      "several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of\n",
      "holding her tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I'd\n",
      "rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem!\" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you so,\" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in\n",
      "the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you speak French, dear?\" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often\n",
      "as I like,\" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old\n",
      "lady to smile affably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you about languages?\" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know a word.  I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't\n",
      "bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,\" was the\n",
      "brusque reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,\n",
      "\"You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe?  Eyes don't\n",
      "trouble you any more, do they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all, thank you, ma'am.  I'm very well, and mean to do great\n",
      "things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that\n",
      "joyful time arrives.\"\n",

      "Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was\n",
      "considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\n",
      "invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the\n",
      "matter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\n",
      "parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her\n",
      "life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on\n",
      "easily.  The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone,\n",
      "but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the\n",
      "art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate\n",
      "and valuable contributions to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then\n",
      "there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\n",
      "impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,\n",
      "with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\n",
      "favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling\n",
      "circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy's dainty\n",
      "pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases--that was one\n",
      "thorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at\n",
      "a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two.  But\n",
      "the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for\n",
      "her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had\n",
      "whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the\n",
      "Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her\n",
      "naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the\n",
      "frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.  No hint of this had\n",
      "reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when,\n",
      "the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches\n",
      "to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the\n",
      "supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a\n",
      "cold look...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\n",
      "my giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most\n",
      "prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\n",
      "the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\n",
      "this place.  I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\n",
      "the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\n",
      "another table if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this\n",
      "little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to\n",
      "utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at\n",
      "her full of surprise and trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess\n",
      "what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,\n",
      "\"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.  It's merely a matter\n",
      "of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this\n",
      "table is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to\n",
      "you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but\n",
      "we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you\n",
      "have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The\n",
      "little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a\n",
      "charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Especially to gentlemen,\" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\n",
      "as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,\n",
      "but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with\n",
      "unexpected amiability...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I'll give up my place here\n",
      "at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,\" began\n",
      "May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\n",
      "racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so\n",
      "carefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but\n",
      "Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,\" and sweeping her\n",
      "contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that\n",
      "herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now she's mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,  Mama,\"\n",
      "said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls' quarrels are soon over,\" returned her mother, feeling a trifle\n",
      "ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which\n",
      "cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell\n",
      "to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.\n",
      "But everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.\n",
      "Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the\n",
      "little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered\n",
      "like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless\n",
      "efforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch\n",
      "wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to\n",
      "tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best\n",
      "tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's\n",
      "cheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a\n",
      "draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the\n",
      "morrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will\n",
      "sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was great indignation at home when she told her story that\n",
      "evening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\n",
      "right.  Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo\n",
      "demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean\n",
      "people to get on without her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such\n",
      "things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to\n",
      "show it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy\n",
      "actions, won't they, Marmee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,\n",
      "though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,\" said her mother, with\n",
      "the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\n",
      "practicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\n",
      "Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\n",
      "enemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that\n",
      "came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her\n",
      "table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling\n",
      "the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique\n",
      "cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which\n",
      "on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.\n",
      "As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable\n",
      "pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.\n",
      "Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little\n",
      "spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns\n",
      "and flowers, were the words, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I ought, but I don't,\" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\n",
      "page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\n",
      "hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a\n",
      "minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet\n",
      "rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise\n",
      "and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in\n",
      "street, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a\n",
      "pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out\n",
      "of season.  Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that\n",
      "text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,\n",
      "took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\n",
      "things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their\n",
      "voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\n",
      "story and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better\n",
      "spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving\n",
      "it.  She heard May say sorrowfully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\n",
      "want to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.\n",
      "Now it's spoiled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,\" suggested someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could I after all the fuss?\" began May, but she did not finish,\n",
      "for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I\n",
      "was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your\n",
      "table rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive\n",
      "me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,\n",
      "and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly\n",
      "thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?\" cried one girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was\n",
      "evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a\n",
      "disagreeable laugh, \"Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell them\n",
      "at her own table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have\n",
      "them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done\n",
      "it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as\n",
      "she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table\n",
      "to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that\n",
      "one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her\n",
      "table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few\n",
      "cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\n",
      "before night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd\n",
      "about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and\n",
      "fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked\n",
      "wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and\n",
      "happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no\n",
      "hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not\n",
      "only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his\n",
      "friends made it a real martyrdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\n",
      "that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\n",
      "complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave\n",
      "her an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a\n",
      "charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by\n",
      "getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the\n",
      "tables were about to be turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so let it\n",
      "all pass and behave yourself,\" begged Amy, as she departed early,\n",
      "hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I\n",
      "know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and\n",
      "his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet.\" returned\n",
      "Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar\n",
      "tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that my boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As sure as this is my girl!\" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm\n",
      "with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Teddy, such doings!\" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be\n",
      "hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down\n",
      "before her table afterward,\" said Laurie, espousing her cause with\n",
      "warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not\n",
      "arrive in time.  I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I\n",
      "shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean\n",
      "thing they are very likely to do another,\" observed Jo in a disgusted\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was\n",
      "poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are\n",
      "just as much yours as mine.  Don't we always go halves in everything?\"\n",
      "began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at\n",
      "all.  But we mustn't stand philandering here.  I've got to help Amy, so\n",
      "you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to\n",
      "let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you\n",
      "forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you do it now?\" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut\n",
      "the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the\n",
      "bars, \"Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for\n",
      "Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged\n",
      "in his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out\n",
      "en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only\n",
      "came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and\n",
      "apparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends\n",
      "gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,\n",
      "encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in\n",
      "the room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing\n",
      "more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the\n",
      "conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily\n",
      "surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking\n",
      "up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of\n",
      "the Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of\n",
      "the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She\n",
      "also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and\n",
      "considered her a model of magnanimity.  As she passed the art table,\n",
      "she glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no sign of them.\n",
      "\"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,\" thought Jo, who could forgive\n",
      "her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, Miss Jo.  How does Amy get on?\" asked May with a\n",
      "conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be\n",
      "generous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is\n",
      "enjoying herself.  The flower table is always attractive, you know,\n",
      "'especially to gentlemen'.\" Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap,\n",
      "but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to\n",
      "praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about?  I took a fancy to buy that for\n",
      "Father,\" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything of Amy's sold long ago.  I took care that the right people\n",
      "saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,\" returned\n",
      "May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,\n",
      "that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked\n",
      "both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables\n",
      "as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,\" she said,\n",
      "ordering out 'Teddy's own', as the girls called the college friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but do your\n",
      "duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in every sense\n",
      "of the word,\" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx\n",
      "prepared to take the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,\" said little\n",
      "Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and\n",
      "getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, my son, for a small boy!\" and walked him off, with a\n",
      "paternal pat on the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Buy the vases,\" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals\n",
      "of fire on her enemy's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but\n",
      "pervaded the hall with one under each arm.  The other gentlemen\n",
      "speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\n",
      "wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\n",
      "fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\n",
      "something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\n",
      "with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\n",
      "anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\n",
      "several days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she\n",
      "did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\n",
      "which said 'forgive and forget'.  That satisfied Amy, and when she got\n",
      "home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a\n",
      "great bouquet in each.  \"The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,\"\n",
      "as Laurie announced with a flourish.\n",

      "planned at first to ask Jo, but as 'favors burden her', and she 'hates\n",
      "French', I think I won't venture to invite her.  Amy is more docile,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!  Why can't I learn to keep it\n",

      "sorrowfully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so\n",

      "all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted\n",
      "in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears,\n",
      "and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how\n",
      "gratefully she would bear it.\n",

      "By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family\n",
      "jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without\n",
      "repinings at Amy's good fortune.  The young lady herself received the\n",
      "news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\n",
      "and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\n",
      "such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\n",
      "aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face\n",
      "at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\n",
      "vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't.  You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\n",
      "will.  I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\n",
      "should like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\n",
      "the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\n",
      "drawing teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh.  \"If you wish it you'll have it, for your\n",
      "wishes are always granted--mine never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\n",

      "\"Rather!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day\n",
      "comes, if it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but\n",
      "magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment\n",
      "till Amy was off.  Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\n",
      "ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\n",
      "till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\n",
      "steamer sailed.  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\n",
      "suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\n",

      "ago, and won't go anywhere else.  However, we don't mean to stay long,\n",

      "I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after\n",
      "that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of\n",
      "pleasant people to amuse me.  Everyone was very kind to me, especially\n",
      "the officers.  Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary\n",
      "aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have\n",

      "\n",
      "Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so\n",
      "when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself.  Such\n",
      "walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves!  It was\n",
      "almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so\n",
      "grandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much\n",

      "It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found\n",
      "it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,\n",
      "ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the\n",
      "valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,\n",
      "but I didn't regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of\n",

      "At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when\n",

      "dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved\n",
      "_à la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he\n",
      "looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned\n",
      "off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in\n",
      "them, and said, with a grin, \"There yer har, sir.  I've given 'em the\n",

      "what that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with\n",
      "us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was\n",

      "\n",
      "I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.  The trip was like riding\n",
      "through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The\n",
      "farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,\n",
      "latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The\n",
      "very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in\n",
      "clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got\n",
      "nervous like Yankee biddies.  Such perfect color I never saw, the grass\n",
      "so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a\n",
      "rapture all the way.  So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to\n",
      "the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the\n",
      "rate of sixty miles an hour.  Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but\n",
      "Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This\n",
      "is the way we went on.  Amy, flying up--\"Oh, that must be Kenilworth,\n",
      "that gray place among the trees!\"  Flo, darting to my window--\"How\n",
      "sweet!  We must go there sometime, won't we Papa?\" Uncle, calmly\n",
      "admiring his boots--\"No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a\n",
      "brewery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause--then Flo cried out, \"Bless me, there's a gallows and a man\n",
      "going up.\"  \"Where, where?\" shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts\n",
      "with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.  \"A colliery,\" remarks\n",
      "Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.  \"Here's a lovely flock of lambs all\n",
      "lying down,\" says Amy.  \"See, Papa, aren't they pretty?\" added Flo\n",
      "sentimentally.  \"Geese, young ladies,\" returns Uncle, in a tone that\n",
      "keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the _Flirtations of\n",
      "Captain Cavendish_, and I have the scenery all to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be\n",
      "seen but fog and umbrellas.  We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little\n",
      "between the showers.  Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off\n",
      "in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a\n",
      "muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping\n",
      "in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice\n",
      "ribbons only sixpence a yard.  I laid in a stock, but shall get my\n",
      "gloves in Paris.  Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?\n",
      "\n",
      "Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and\n",
      "Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that\n",
      "it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone.  It was so\n",
      "droll!  For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so\n",
      "fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up\n",
      "outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him.  He didn't hear me\n",
      "call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite\n",
      "helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck\n",
      "pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on\n",
      "poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, then, mum?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with\n",
      "an \"Aye, aye, mum,\" the man made his horse walk, as if going to a\n",
      "funeral.  I poked again and said, \"A little faster,\" then off he went,\n",
      "helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more\n",
      "aristocratic than we look.  The Duke of Devonshire lives near.  I often\n",
      "see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington's\n",
      "house is not far off.  Such sights as I saw, my dear!  It was as good\n",
      "as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and\n",
      "yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet\n",
      "coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front.  Smart maids, with\n",
      "the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,\n",
      "dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and\n",
      "tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,\n",
      "looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotten Row means 'Route de Roi', or the king's way, but now it's more\n",
      "like a riding school than anything else.  The horses are splendid, and\n",
      "the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and\n",
      "bounce, which isn't according to our rules.  I longed to show them a\n",
      "tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in\n",
      "their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy\n",
      "Noah's Ark.  Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little\n",
      "children--and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair\n",
      "exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole,\n",
      "and I thought it rather a nice little idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the P.M.  to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe it,\n",
      "that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening we are\n",

      "was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the cards.\n",
      "Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English\n",
      "style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no\n",

      "ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call,\n",
      "and see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did\n",
      "have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I\n",
      "talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other\n",
      "all our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of\n",

      "upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the\n",
      "dull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling\n",
      "like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, \"All serene! Coming\n",
      "in tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\n",

      "tear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her\n",
      "half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.\n",
      "Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about\n",
      "needing more paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\n",

      "He must.  I'll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\n",
      "picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\n",
      "\"Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here's Meg married and a\n",
      "mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I'm the only\n",
      "one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.\" Jo thought intently\n",
      "for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out\n",
      "her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face\n",
      "opposite, \"No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more\n",
      "stability than a weathercock.  So you needn't write touching notes and\n",
      "smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I\n",
      "won't have it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake\n",
      "till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\n",
      "only confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\n",
      "with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\n",
      "but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\n",
      "cared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression\n",
      "had prevailed in the family of late that 'our boy' was getting fonder\n",
      "than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject\n",
      "and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known\n",
      "the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they\n",
      "would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\"\n",
      "But Jo hated 'philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a\n",

      "When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,\n",

      "amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,\n",
      "despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\n",
      "conferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at\n",
      "many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\n",
      "occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender\n",
      "subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\n",
      "and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate in a\n",
      "blaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight\n",
      "confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\n",
      "eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\n",
      "imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former\n",
      "could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter\n",
      "were less manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo\n",
      "watched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not\n",
      "got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\n",
      "the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But\n",
      "having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\n",
      "a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\n",
      "of romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on\n",
      "the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\n",
      "sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly 'spin', and he never\n",
      "disappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\n",
      "on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that\n",
      "she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\n",
      "cricket match, though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off\n",
      "his ground', and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her\n",
      "as Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,\n",
      "that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that\n",
      "he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a\n",
      "little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an\n",
      "assiduity that was really almost tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\n",
      "about the room.  \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\n",
      "life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love\n",
      "each other.  I don't see how he can help it, and I do believe he would\n",
      "if the rest of us were out of the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she\n",
      "ought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?\n",
      "And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she\n",
      "sat down to settle that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,\n",

      "women.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner\n",
      "had always been Jo's favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows\n",
      "that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with\n",
      "prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.\n",
      "This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon\n",
      "of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep\n",
      "aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when\n",
      "romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he\n",
      "most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If 'the sausage' as they\n",
      "called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and\n",
      "repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child\n",
      "who dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,\n",
      "and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form\n",
      "appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both\n",
      "long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of\n",

      "\"Now, this is filling at the price.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,\n",
      "there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared\n",
      "in a most mysterious manner.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,\n",

      "\n",

      "natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society\n",
      "showed him many samples.  Jo knew that 'young Laurence' was regarded as\n",
      "a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their\n",
      "daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\n",
      "of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be\n",
      "spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still\n",
      "believed in modest girls.  Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone,\n",
      "she said, dropping her voice, \"If you must have a 'vent', Teddy, go and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the\n",

      "little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I'm not!\" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite\n",

      "his own.\n",

      "\"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't, there is no cure.\"  There Beth's voice gave way, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot\n",
      "forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to\n",
      "speak.  But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,\n",
      "cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she\n",
      "believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her\n",

      "with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling\n",
      "that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\n",

      "apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was\n",
      "perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the\n",
      "gentlemen that her little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good\n",

      "\"I'll call.  Good morning, Sir.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her\n",

      "trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood\n",
      "graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not\n",
      "thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his\n",
      "hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher\n",
      "wages, had basely left him in the lurch.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\n",
      "stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the\n",
      "mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.  One\n",
      "thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell\n",
      "them at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not\n",
      "approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon\n",
      "afterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with\n",
      "her stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but\n",
      "promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\n",
      "nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\n",
      "conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show\n",
      "her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could\n",
      "not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,\n",
      "history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and\n",
      "lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found\n",
      "that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the\n",
      "tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business\n",
      "light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic\n",
      "energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them\n",
      "original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers\n",
      "for accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of\n",
      "public librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in\n",
      "the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.\n",
      "She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old\n",
      "that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,\n",
      "and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought\n",
      "she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to\n",
      "desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.\n",
      "She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its\n",
      "influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on\n",
      "dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent\n",
      "bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side\n",
      "of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\n",
      "other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and\n",
      "speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young\n",
      "minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own\n",
      "punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\n",
      "character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\n",
      "brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\n",
      "perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who\n",
      "interested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one\n",
      "of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and\n",
      "lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a\n",
      "writer.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and\n",
      "studied him--a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he\n",
      "known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither\n",
      "rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called\n",
      "fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a\n",
      "genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as\n",
      "about a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving\n",
      "something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer\n",
      "young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face\n",
      "looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his\n",
      "sake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last\n",
      "decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had\n",
      "any sorrow, 'it sat with its head under its wing', and he turned only\n",
      "his sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but\n",
      "Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\n",
      "others.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\n",
      "friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and\n",
      "his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\n",
      "wearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\n",
      "comfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\n",
      "underneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\n",
      "plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.\n",
      "His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\n",
      "like other people's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\n",
      "genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and dignify\n",
      "even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own\n",
      "socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\n",
      "respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\n",
      "Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\n",
      "and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\n",
      "honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\n",
      "to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss\n",
      "Norton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked\n",
      "it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud\n",
      "to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor\n",
      "language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much\n",
      "beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.\n",
      "Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\n",
      "unexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which\n",
      "Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman\n",
      "felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\n",
      "favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with\n",
      "her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several\n",
      "celebrities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\n",
      "worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for\n",
      "genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\n",
      "recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\n",
      "women after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\n",
      "admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\n",
      "'spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an\n",
      "ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a\n",
      "fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\n",
      "romantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\n",
      "with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly\n",
      "with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at\n",
      "another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering\n",
      "her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea\n",
      "Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady\n",
      "rendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting\n",
      "their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting\n",
      "themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young\n",
      "musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked\n",
      "horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be\n",
      "the most ordinary man of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,\n",
      "that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\n",
      "her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\n",
      "philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\n",
      "intellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles\n",
      "beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel\n",
      "were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,\n",
      "and the only thing 'evolved from her inner consciousness' was a bad\n",
      "headache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the\n",
      "world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,\n",
      "according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,\n",
      "that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and\n",
      "intellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or\n",
      "metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,\n",
      "half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being\n",
      "turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a\n",
      "holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\n",
      "looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\n",
      "He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated\n",
      "just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,\n",
      "trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after\n",
      "they had annihilated all the old beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,\n",
      "not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\n",
      "lightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\n",
      "attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit\n",
      "his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\n",
      "would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over\n",
      "that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an\n",
      "opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion\n",
      "with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken\n",
      "English musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for\n",
      "the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and\n",
      "stood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got\n",
      "right again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\n",
      "better than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was\n",
      "not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid\n",
      "ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but\n",
      "not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor\n",
      "her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\n",
      "then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.\n",
      "She began to see that character is a better possession than money,\n",
      "rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a\n",
      "wise man has defined it to be, 'truth, reverence, and good will', then\n",
      "her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\n",
      "\n",
      "This belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his\n",
      "respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the\n",
      "wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew\n",
      "out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo\n",
      "her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put\n",
      "there and he had forgotten to take off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\n",
      "Jo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down,\n",
      "quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\n",
      "headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\n",
      "hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\n",
      "it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German\n",
      "read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading\n",
      "came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that\n",
      "night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The\n",
      "Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask\n",
      "with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\n",
      "respect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\n",
      "said Jo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt\n",
      "and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then\n",
      "threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my\n",
      "cap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,\n",
      "you too shall wear him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer\n",
      "caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great\n",
      "disgust, \"I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not\n",
      "for children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I\n",
      "haf no patience with those who make this harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\n",
      "lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but\n",
      "the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but\n",
      "fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It\n",
      "was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if\n",
      "it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no\n",
      "name to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a\n",
      "blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more\n",
      "than people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among\n",
      "the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he\n",
      "asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it\n",
      "occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\n",
      "troubled him.  He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business.\n",
      "I've no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done.  He\n",
      "only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from\n",
      "mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an\n",
      "impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out\n",
      "his hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his\n",
      "mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by\n",
      "the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready\n",
      "to say quite naturally, but very gravely...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young\n",
      "girls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I\n",
      "would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\n",
      "trash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for\n",
      "it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\n",
      "make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,\" said\n",
      "Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\n",
      "followed her pin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to\n",
      "sell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\n",
      "not feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison\n",
      "in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think\n",
      "a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\n",
      "his hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for\n",
      "her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and\n",
      "gone harmlessly up the chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\n",
      "Professor, coming back with a relieved air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\n",
      "hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\n",
      "Then she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that, they\n",
      "are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,\" and taking up her\n",
      "book, she said, with a studious face, \"Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be\n",
      "very good and proper now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she\n",
      "imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the\n",
      "words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully\n",
      "reread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.\n",
      "Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling\n",
      "to see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed\n",
      "to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the\n",
      "faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her\n",
      "with dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is\n",
      "more sensational than the last.  I've gone blindly on, hurting myself\n",
      "and other people, for the sake of money.  I know it's so, for I can't\n",
      "read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,\n",
      "and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of\n",
      "them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\n",
      "stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better\n",
      "burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves\n",
      "up with my gunpowder,\" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura\n",
      "whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a heap\n",
      "of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\n",
      "floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my\n",
      "time,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\n",
      "wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient.  If I didn't care\n",
      "about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\n",
      "should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother\n",
      "and Father hadn't been so particular about such things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and Mother were\n",
      "particular', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians\n",
      "to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to\n",
      "impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build\n",
      "character upon in womanhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\n",
      "pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as\n",
      "is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.\n",
      "Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale\n",
      "which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so\n",
      "intensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the\n",
      "beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease\n",
      "in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and\n",
      "cumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to\n",
      "several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to\n",
      "agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\n",
      "if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.\n",
      "The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\n",
      "juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\n",
      "convert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked\n",
      "to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty\n",
      "boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did\n",
      "not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did\n",
      "go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to\n",
      "escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons\n",
      "on their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo\n",
      "corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know anything.  I'll wait until I do before I try again, and\n",
      "meantime, 'sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, that's\n",
      "honest, at least.\"  Which decision proved that her second tumble down\n",
      "the beanstalk had done her some good.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\n",
      "been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked\n",
      "serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did\n",
      "it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\n",
      "accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was\n",
      "satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she\n",
      "had given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\n",
      "second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\n",
      "evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\n",
      "studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\n",
      "occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was\n",
      "happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons\n",
      "besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her\n",
      "own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.\n",
      "Kirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The\n",
      "children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all\n",
      "over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\n",
      "when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner,\n",
      "while she held a little levee on that last evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when\n",
      "his turn came, she said warmly, \"Now, Sir, you won't forget to come and\n",
      "see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never forgive you if\n",
      "you do, for I want them all to know my friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you?  Shall I come?\" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\n",
      "expression which she did not see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, come next month.  Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy\n",
      "commencement as something new.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?\" he said in an altered\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my boy Teddy.  I'm very proud of him and should like you to see\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure\n",
      "in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.\n",
      "Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more\n",
      "than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to\n",
      "look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,\n",
      "and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been\n",
      "for Tina on her knee.  She didn't know what would have become of her.\n",
      "Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her\n",
      "face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and\n",
      "his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual\n",
      "expression, as he said cordially...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\n",
      "success, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!\"  And with that, he\n",
      "shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the\n",
      "tired look on his face and the 'heimweh', or homesickness, lying heavy\n",
      "at his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little\n",
      "child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head\n",
      "on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search\n",
      "of something that he could not find.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not for me, I must not hope it now,\" he said to himself, with a\n",
      "sigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the\n",
      "longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled\n",
      "heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened\n",
      "his Plato.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found that a\n",
      "pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very\n",
      "satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and\n",
      "thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory\n",
      "of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her\n",
      "company, and best of all, the happy thought, \"Well, the winter's gone,\n",
      "and I've written no books, earned no fortune, but I've made a friend\n",
      "worth having and I'll try to keep him all my life.\"\n",

      "Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose\n",
      "that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with\n",
      "the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his\n",
      "friends said.  They were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him\n",
      "with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but\n",
      "fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early\n",
      "tomorrow.  You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?\" Laurie said, as he\n",
      "put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.\n",
      "He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up\n",
      "the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid,\n",
      "successful boy anything, and answered warmly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing 'Hail\n",
      "the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,\n",
      "\"Oh, deary me!  I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and\n",
      "having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were\n",
      "going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her\n",
      "answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy\n",
      "wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at\n",
      "Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still\n",
      "further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart\n",
      "figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about\n",
      "and run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?\" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\n",
      "speaking distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot it.\" And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not\n",
      "be called lover-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,\n",
      "and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly\n",
      "about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road\n",
      "into the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he\n",
      "walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now\n",
      "and then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from\n",
      "one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said\n",
      "hastily, \"Now you must have a good long holiday!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I intend to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him\n",
      "looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded\n",
      "moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, \"No,\n",
      "Teddy.  Please don't!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, and you must hear me.  It's no use, Jo, we've got to have it\n",
      "out, and the sooner the better for both of us,\" he answered, getting\n",
      "flushed and excited all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say what you like then.  I'll listen,\" said Jo, with a desperate sort\n",
      "of patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to 'have it\n",
      "out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with\n",
      "characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now\n",
      "and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it, you've\n",
      "been so good to me.  I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.\n",
      "Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can't go\n",
      "on so any longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wanted to save you this.  I thought you'd understand...\" began Jo,\n",
      "finding it a great deal harder than she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they\n",
      "mean.  They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits\n",
      "just for the fun of it,\" returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an\n",
      "undeniable fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't.  I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away\n",
      "to keep you from it if I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so.  It was like you, but it was no use.  I only loved you\n",
      "all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards\n",
      "and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I\n",
      "hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough...\" Here there was\n",
      "a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while\n",
      "he cleared his 'confounded throat'.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful\n",
      "to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you\n",
      "as you want me to.  I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it\n",
      "would be a lie to say I do when I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, truly, Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\n",
      "a look that she did not soon forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, truly, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words\n",
      "fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as\n",
      "if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him.\n",
      "So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still\n",
      "that Jo was frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it\n",
      "would do any good!  I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I can't help\n",
      "it.  You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other\n",
      "people if they don't,\" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she\n",
      "softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted\n",
      "her so long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do sometimes,\" said a muffled voice from the post. \"I don't\n",
      "believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try it,\" was\n",
      "the decided answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow\n",
      "by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\n",
      "very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, \"Laurie, I want\n",
      "to tell you something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in\n",
      "a fierce tone, \"Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear it now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell what?\" she asked, wondering at his violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you love that old man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What old man?\" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\n",
      "love him, I know I shall do something desperate;\" and he looked as if\n",
      "he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark\n",
      "in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she\n",
      "too, was getting excited with all this, \"Don't swear, Teddy!  He isn't\n",
      "old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got,\n",
      "next to you.  Pray, don't fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I\n",
      "know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor.  I haven't the least\n",
      "idea of loving him or anybody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\n",
      "trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!\n",
      "Never!\" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I do with him?\" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\n",
      "unmanagable than she expected.  \"You haven't heard what I wanted to\n",
      "tell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make\n",
      "you happy,\" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\n",
      "proved that she knew nothing about love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on\n",
      "the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,\n",
      "and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was\n",
      "not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part, for how\n",
      "could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\n",
      "full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\n",
      "two her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his\n",
      "head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed\n",
      "to grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure! \"I agree with\n",
      "Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick\n",
      "tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we\n",
      "were so foolish as to...\" Jo paused a little over the last word, but\n",
      "Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marry--no we shouldn't!  If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\n",
      "saint, for you could make me anything you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can't.  I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by\n",
      "such a serious experiment.  We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll\n",
      "be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we will if we get the chance,\" muttered Laurie rebelliously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,\" implored\n",
      "Jo, almost at her wit's end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't be reasonable.  I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\n",
      "view'.  It won't help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don't believe\n",
      "you've got any heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I hadn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,\n",
      "Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\n",
      "said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\n",
      "wheedlesome before, \"Don't disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it.\n",
      "Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get\n",
      "on without you.  Say you will, and let's be happy.  Do, do!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength\n",
      "of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided\n",
      "that she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to\n",
      "do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say 'yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.  You'll see that\n",
      "I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...\" she began solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\n",
      "with indignation at the very idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you will!\" persisted Jo.  \"You'll get over this after a while,\n",
      "and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a\n",
      "fine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward\n",
      "and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we\n",
      "can't help it even now, you see--and I shouldn't like elegant society\n",
      "and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\n",
      "without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\n",
      "everything would be horrid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything more?\" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\n",
      "this prophetic burst.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.  I'm\n",
      "happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it\n",
      "up for any mortal man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know better!\" broke in Laurie.  \"You think so now, but there'll come\n",
      "a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll love him\n",
      "tremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it's your\n",
      "way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,\" and the despairing lover\n",
      "cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed\n",
      "comical, if his face had not been so tragic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\n",
      "him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!\" cried Jo,\n",
      "losing patience with poor Teddy.  \"I've done my best, but you won't be\n",
      "reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\n",
      "give.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,\n",
      "but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for\n",
      "both of us--so now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he\n",
      "did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,\n",
      "saying in a desperate sort of tone, \"You'll be sorry some day, Jo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, where are you going?\" she cried, for his face frightened her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the devil!\" was the consoling answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank\n",
      "toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a\n",
      "young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort\n",
      "who are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a\n",
      "melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\n",
      "coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\n",
      "up the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and\n",
      "unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\n",
      "the trouble which he carried in his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\n",
      "state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him,\" she said, adding, as she\n",
      "went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\n",
      "and buried it under the leaves.  \"Now I must go and prepare Mr.\n",
      "Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he'd love Beth,\n",
      "perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.\n",
      "Oh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think\n",
      "it's dreadful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went\n",
      "straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then\n",
      "broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind\n",
      "old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.\n",
      "He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving\n",
      "Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better\n",
      "than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and\n",
      "resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's\n",
      "parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather\n",
      "met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\n",
      "successfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the\n",
      "twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\n",
      "old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\n",
      "listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\n",
      "like love's labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to\n",
      "his piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking\n",
      "in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her\n",
      "sister, for he played the '_Sonata Pathetique_', and played it as he\n",
      "never did before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry.\n",
      "Give us something gayer, lad,\" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart\n",
      "was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several\n",
      "minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull\n",
      "Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, \"Jo, dear, come in.  I\n",
      "want you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he\n",
      "listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and\n",
      "the musician sat silent in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't stand this,\" muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped\n",
      "his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad\n",
      "shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, \"I know, my boy, I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, \"Who told you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then there's an end of it!\"  And he shook off his grandfather's hands\n",
      "with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his\n",
      "man's pride could not bear a man's pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\n",
      "it,\" returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. \"You won't care to\n",
      "stay at home now, perhaps?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to run away from a girl.  Jo can't prevent my seeing\n",
      "her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,\" interrupted Laurie\n",
      "in a defiant tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I'm disappointed, but the\n",
      "girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\n",
      "for a time.  Where will you go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anywhere.  I don't care what becomes of me,\" and Laurie got up with a\n",
      "reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake.  Why\n",
      "not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\n",
      "through college.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!\" and Laurie walked fast through the\n",
      "room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't ask you to go alone.  There's someone ready and glad to go\n",
      "with you, anywhere in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who, Sir?\" stopping to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying\n",
      "huskily, \"I'm a selfish brute, but--you know--Grandfather--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before,\n",
      "once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,\n",
      "just sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It's all settled, and can be\n",
      "carried out at once,\" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,\n",
      "as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir, what is it?\" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of\n",
      "interest in face or voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you\n",
      "should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here\n",

      "Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from\n",
      "home.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and\n",
      "as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took\n",

      "heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there\n",
      "seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to\n",

      "could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,\n",
      "and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells\n",
      "they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever\n",
      "that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively\n",
      "tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a\n",
      "minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth\n",
      "was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?\" asked Beth, as\n",

      "Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows\n",
      "itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than\n",
      "homilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the\n",
      "faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and\n",
      "cheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no\n",
      "questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of\n",

      "from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He\n",
      "draws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, \"I'm glad to go,\" for\n",

      "till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little\n",
      "gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach 'peeping' softly to\n",

      "\"How is your grandfather?  When did you come?  Where are you staying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.  I called at your hotel, but\n",
      "you were out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin!  Get in and we can\n",

      "Flo's saving up for tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What happens then, a ball?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Christmas party at our hotel.  There are many Americans there, and\n",
      "they give it in honor of the day.  You'll go with us, of course?  Aunt\n",
      "will be charmed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  Where now?\" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his\n",
      "arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her\n",
      "parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her\n",
      "infinite satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill.\n",
      "The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\n",
      "been there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now tell me all about yourself.  The last I heard of you, your\n",
      "grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has\n",
      "settled for the winter.  He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse\n",
      "him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a sociable arrangement,\" said Amy, missing something in\n",
      "Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each\n",
      "suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.  I am often with him, and he\n",
      "enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see\n",
      "me when I get back from my wanderings.  Dirty old hole, isn't it?\" he\n",
      "added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the\n",
      "Place Napoleon in the old city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind.  The river and the hills are\n",
      "delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my\n",
      "delight.  Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass.  It's\n",
      "going to the Church of St.  John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\n",
      "canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some\n",
      "brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt\n",
      "a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could\n",
      "not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside\n",
      "her.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but\n",
      "now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired\n",
      "and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver\n",
      "than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She\n",
      "couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she\n",
      "shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away\n",
      "across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Que pensez-vous?\" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\n",
      "quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\n",
      "charming,\" replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an\n",
      "admiring look.\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\n",
      "her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\n",
      "promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\n",
      "'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\n",
      "head.  She didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded\n",
      "indifferent in spite of the look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,\" she\n",
      "thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\n",
      "meantime to seem quite easy and gay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins\n",
      "to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road\n",
      "between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beth is very poorly, Mother says.  I often think I ought to go home,\n",
      "but they all say 'stay'.  So I do, for I shall never have another\n",
      "chance like this,\" said Amy, looking sober over one page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you are right, there.  You could do nothing at home, and it is\n",
      "a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and\n",
      "enjoying so much, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said\n",
      "that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,\n",
      "for the look, the act, the brotherly 'my dear', seemed to assure her\n",
      "that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\n",
      "Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\n",
      "scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\n",
      "from her mouth the words, 'Genius burns!'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it from\n",
      "blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\n",
      "morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,\" said\n",
      "Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\n",
      "splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\n",
      "While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\n",
      "to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\n",
      "with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\n",
      "wrought.  He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\n",
      "approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\n",
      "manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\n",
      "that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\n",
      "elegance.  Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb\n",
      "in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\n",
      "of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed\n",
      "itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness\n",
      "was unspoiled by foreign polish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,\n",
      "but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a\n",
      "pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,\n",
      "which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her\n",
      "cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure\n",
      "in the pleasant scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\n",
      "her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\n",
      "here and there, \"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the\n",
      "fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa\n",
      "Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far\n",
      "out to sea which they say is Corsica?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember.  It's not much changed,\" he answered without enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!\" said Amy,\n",
      "feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\n",
      "island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\n",
      "in his sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what\n",
      "you have been doing with yourself all this while,\" said Amy, seating\n",
      "herself, ready for a good talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her\n",
      "questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\n",
      "Continent and been to Greece.  So after idling away an hour, they drove\n",
      "home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\n",
      "them, promising to return in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night.\n",
      "Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had\n",
      "seen her old friend in a new light, not as 'our boy', but as a handsome\n",
      "and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\n",
      "find favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most\n",
      "of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and\n",
      "pretty woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\n",
      "on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple\n",
      "dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\n",
      "flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\n",
      "both inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist\n",
      "sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\n",
      "coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\n",
      "heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\n",
      "such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\n",
      "our hearts merry with their artless vanities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,\" said\n",
      "Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and\n",
      "covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white\n",
      "shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair\n",
      "she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and\n",
      "curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a\n",
      "fright of myself,\" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\n",
      "braid, as the latest style commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\n",
      "her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\n",
      "shoulders in delicate green vines.  Remembering the painted boots, she\n",
      "surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\n",
      "chassed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\n",
      "real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\n",
      "had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,\" she said,\n",
      "surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\n",
      "she glided away.  She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she\n",
      "thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\n",
      "than the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon\n",
      "while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\n",
      "chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought\n",
      "better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\n",
      "of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so\n",
      "happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came\n",
      "in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant\n",
      "window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,\n",
      "the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as\n",
      "a well-placed statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, Diana!\" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\n",
      "liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, Apollo!\" she answered, smiling back at him, for he too\n",
      "looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on\n",
      "the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\n",
      "Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you\n",
      "didn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay',\" said Laurie, handing her\n",
      "a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\n",
      "passed it in Cardiglia's window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are!\" she exclaimed gratefully.  \"If I'd known you were\n",
      "coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty\n",
      "as this, I'm afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,\" he\n",
      "added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you liked that sort of thing.\"\n",

      "better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of it,\" he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her\n",
      "gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to\n",
      "do when they went to parties together at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was\n",
      "such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.  The hospitable\n",
      "Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having\n",
      "no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their\n",
      "Christmas ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk\n",
      "with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with\n",
      "a pearl bridle under her chin.  A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\n",
      "himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, 'a fascinating dear', and a\n",
      "German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely\n",
      "about, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild's private\n",
      "secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\n",
      "world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout\n",
      "Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\n",
      "and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\n",
      "family of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,\n",
      "shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,\n",
      "and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set\n",
      "of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while\n",
      "mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly\n",
      "when they danced with their daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she 'took the\n",
      "stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm.  She knew she looked well,\n",
      "she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a\n",
      "ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when\n",
      "young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to\n",
      "rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis\n",
      "girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim\n",
      "papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her\n",
      "friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it\n",
      "permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who\n",
      "her distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the\n",
      "band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap\n",
      "the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know\n",
      "it.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than\n",
      "described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, \"Do you care to\n",
      "dance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One usually does at a ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\n",
      "fast as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I meant the first dance.  May I have the honor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can give you one if I put off the Count.  He dances divinely, but he\n",
      "will excuse me, as you are an old friend,\" said Amy, hoping that the\n",
      "name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\n",
      "trifled with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...\n",
      "\n",
      "    A daughter of the gods,\n",
      "    Devinely tall, and most divinely fair,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "was all the satisfaction she got, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\n",
      "was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the\n",
      "while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie\n",
      "resigned her to the 'nice little boy', and went to do his duty to Flo,\n",
      "without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\n",
      "forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\n",
      "till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She\n",
      "showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled\n",
      "instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka\n",
      "redowa.  But his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she\n",
      "galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with\n",
      "an actual expression of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\n",
      "while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between\n",
      "the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest.  Her anger had a\n",
      "good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed\n",
      "unusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie's eyes followed her with\n",
      "pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\n",
      "and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very\n",
      "naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before\n",
      "the evening was half over, had decided that 'little Amy was going to\n",
      "make a very charming woman'.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\n",
      "possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\n",
      "hearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and\n",
      "banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who\n",
      "couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was\n",
      "dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young\n",
      "giraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor\n",
      "with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin\n",
      "train.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating\n",
      "steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the\n",
      "ravages he committed.  But the Emperor's friend covered himself with\n",
      "glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and\n",
      "introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The\n",
      "boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he\n",
      "'carried weight', he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he\n",
      "flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails\n",
      "waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the\n",
      "music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his\n",
      "fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more\n",
      "graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time\n",
      "to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as\n",
      "indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished\n",
      "her, with assurances that he was 'desolated to leave so early', she was\n",
      "ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\n",
      "find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\n",
      "blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\n",
      "enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up\n",
      "look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring\n",
      "her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, \"Ah, I\n",
      "thought that would do him good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You look like Balzac's '_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_',\" he said, as he\n",
      "fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My rouge won't come off.\" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and\n",
      "showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh\n",

      "when 'Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto.  In America, as everyone\n",
      "knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy\n",
      "their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually\n",
      "abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion\n",
      "almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.\n",
      "Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as\n",
      "soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim,\n",
      "as did a very pretty woman the other day, \"I'm as handsome as ever, but\n",

      "\n",
      "Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\n",
      "this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little\n",
      "world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired\n",
      "and beloved than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very\n",
      "strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter\n",
      "exclusion of everything and everybody else.  Day and night she brooded\n",
      "over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the\n",
      "tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the\n",
      "kitchen department.  Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the\n",
      "wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored\n",
      "his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time,\n",
      "supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.\n",
      "But three months passed, and there was no return of repose.  Meg looked\n",
      "worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the\n",
      "house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life 'aisy', kept\n",
      "him on short commons.  When he went out in the morning he was\n",
      "bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily\n",
      "in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a \"Hush!\n",

      "amusement at home, \"No, it would disturb the babies.\"  If he hinted at\n",
      "a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a\n",
      "decided--\"Leave my children for pleasure, never!\"  His sleep was broken\n",
      "by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to\n",
      "and fro in the watches of the night.  His meals were interrupted by the\n",
      "frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped,\n",

      "paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the shipping list and\n",

      "The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\n",
      "his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual 'hushing' made\n",

      "precincts of Babyland.  He bore it very patiently for six months, and\n",
      "when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\n",
      "do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere.  Scott had married and\n",
      "gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running\n",
      "over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty,\n",
      "and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.  Mrs.\n",
      "Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,\n",
      "and she performed her mission most successfully.  The parlor was always\n",
      "bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty\n",
      "of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.\n",
      "\n",
      "John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so\n",
      "lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and\n",
      "enjoyed his neighbor's society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a\n",
      "relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in\n",
      "the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children.  But\n",
      "by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep\n",
      "at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John,\n",
      "and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite\n",
      "in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the\n",

      "because he did not know that she wanted him without being told,\n",
      "entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain.\n",
      "She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that\n",
      "unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally\n",
      "experience when domestic cares oppress them.  Want of exercise robs\n",
      "them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American\n",

      "Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one\n",

      "natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be\n",
      "remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw\n",
      "you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and\n",
      "John had nothing to do but support them.  I've seen it for some weeks,\n",

      "\"Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you\n",

      "well as to the babies.  Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut\n",
      "him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.  His place is\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice unless\n",

      "just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted\n",
      "myself wholly to you.  Poor Father took to his books, after I had\n",
      "refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone.  I\n",
      "struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me.  I\n",
      "nearly spoiled her by indulgence.  You were poorly, and I worried about\n",
      "you till I fell sick myself.  Then Father came to the rescue, quietly\n",
      "managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake,\n",
      "and never have been able to get on without him since.  That is the\n",
      "secret of our home happiness.  He does not let business wean him from\n",
      "the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let\n",

      "training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have\n",
      "often proposed, let Hannah come and help you.  She is a capital nurse,\n",
      "and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more\n",
      "housework.  You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and\n",
      "John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as\n",
      "busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get\n",
      "dismal there is no fair weather.  Then I'd try to take an interest in\n",
      "whatever John likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange\n",
      "ideas, and help each other in that way.  Don't shut yourself up in a\n",

      "doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will.  Poor John!  I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy.\n",
      "This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow\n",
      "apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the\n",
      "first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it.\n",
      "And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years\n",
      "of the little lives given to them to train.  Don't let John be a\n",
      "stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and\n",
      "happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and\n",
      "through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.\n",
      "Now, dear, good-by.  Think over Mother's preachment, act upon it if it\n",
      "seems good, and God bless you all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\n",
      "first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it.  Of\n",
      "course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as\n",
      "they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they\n",
      "wanted.  Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not\n",
      "so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by\n",
      "an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi\n",
      "inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character, we won't call\n",
      "it obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\n",
      "anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\n",
      "that pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be\n",
      "taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was\n",
      "too soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when\n",
      "he undertook to 'wrastle' with 'Parpar', he always got the worst of it,\n",
      "yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and\n",
      "loved the father whose grave \"No, no,\" was more impressive than all\n",
      "Mamma's love pats.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\n",
      "evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\n",
      "order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early,\n",
      "that nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately\n",
      "Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that\n",
      "night he decided to go on a rampage.  So poor Meg sang and rocked, told\n",
      "stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all\n",
      "in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long after Daisy had gone to\n",
      "byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty\n",
      "Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake\n",
      "expression of countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives\n",
      "poor Papa his tea?\" asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the\n",
      "well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me has tea!\" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go\n",
      "bye-bye like Daisy.  Will you, lovey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Iss!\" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the\n",
      "desired day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran\n",
      "down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow\n",
      "in her hair which was his especial admiration.  He saw it at once and\n",
      "said with pleased surprise, \"Why, little mother, how gay we are\n",
      "tonight.  Do you expect company?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only you, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change.  You always\n",
      "make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why\n",
      "shouldn't I when I have the time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do it out of respect for you, my dear,\" said old-fashioned John.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,\" laughed Meg, looking young and pretty\n",
      "again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times.  This tastes\n",
      "right.  I drink your health, dear.\" and John sipped his tea with an air\n",
      "of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as\n",
      "he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\n",
      "voice was heard, saying impatiently...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Opy doy.  Me's tummin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's that naughty boy.  I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he\n",
      "is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,\"\n",
      "said Meg, answering the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mornin' now,\" announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his\n",
      "long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing\n",
      "gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies' with loving\n",
      "glances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it isn't morning yet.  You must go to bed, and not trouble poor\n",
      "Mamma.  Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me loves Parpar,\" said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal\n",
      "knee and revel in forbidden joys.  But John shook his head, and said to\n",
      "Meg...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do\n",
      "it, or he will never learn to mind you.\"\n",

      "\"Yes, of course.  Come, Demi,\"  and Meg led her son away, feeling a\n",
      "strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,\n",
      "laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as\n",
      "soon as they reached the nursery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him\n",
      "a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more\n",
      "promenades till morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Iss!\" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when\n",
      "the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies\n",
      "by boldly demanding, \"More sudar, Marmar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now this won't do,\" said John, hardening his heart against the\n",
      "engaging little sinner.  \"We shall never know any peace till that child\n",
      "learns to go to bed properly.  You have made a slave of yourself long\n",
      "enough.  Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it.  Put\n",

      "bids you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"S'ant!\" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted\n",

      "\"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar.\" and Demi retired to his mother's\n",
      "skirts for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to\n",
      "the enemy, with a \"Be gentle with him, John,\" which struck the culprit\n",
      "with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at\n",
      "hand.  Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a\n",
      "strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his\n",
      "wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the\n",
      "way upstairs.  The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled\n",
      "out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously\n",
      "caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which\n",
      "lively performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out,\n",
      "when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice.  This vocal\n",
      "exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post\n",
      "which is popularly believed to be deaf.  No coaxing, no sugar, no\n",
      "lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of\n",
      "the fire enlivened the 'big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity\n",
      "rather than fear.  This new order of things disgusted him, and he\n",
      "howled dismally for 'Marmar', as his angry passions subsided, and\n",
      "recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.\n",
      "The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's\n",
      "heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear.  I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and\n",
      "he must, if I stay here all night.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "deserting her boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter\n",

      "interfere, I'll manage him.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by indulgence.  Go\n",
      "down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never\n",
      "regretted her docility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please let me kiss him once, John?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.  Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest,\n",
      "for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it\n",
      "was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom\n",
      "of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.  I'll cover him\n",

      "\n",
      "But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes\n",
      "opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying\n",
      "with a penitent hiccough, \"Me's dood, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which\n",
      "followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible\n",
      "accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi\n",
      "lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a\n",
      "subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and\n",
      "holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered\n",
      "with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,\n",
      "John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed\n",
      "its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that\n",
      "tussle with his son than with his whole day's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\n",
      "herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, \"I\n",
      "never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does\n",
      "know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting\n",
      "too much for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\n",
      "wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a\n",
      "bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the\n",
      "election, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a\n",
      "revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,\n",
      "knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't\n",
      "keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon\n",
      "appear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then\n",
      "explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply\n",
      "interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from\n",
      "wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In\n",
      "her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as\n",
      "mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling\n",
      "each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and\n",
      "when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought\n",
      "diplomatic ambiguity, \"Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty\n",
      "little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it\n",
      "with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like\n",
      "millinery for hers, that's only fair,\" thought John the Just, adding\n",
      "aloud, \"That's very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear man, it's a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater\n",
      "bonnet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of\n",
      "the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,\"\n",
      "and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an\n",
      "air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks\n",
      "young and happy again,\" and John kissed the smiling face, to the great\n",
      "detriment of the rosebud under the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new\n",

      "you, please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You\n",
      "have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall\n",
      "enjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous\n",
      "and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and\n",
      "less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to\n",
      "things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just\n",
      "to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before\n",
      "my time.  It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your\n",
      "sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately,\n",

      "Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little\n",

      "that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which\n",
      "gradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all\n",
      "Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of\n",
      "labor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for\n",
      "accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while\n",
      "Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of\n",
      "wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential\n",
      "conversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and\n",
      "John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts\n",
      "came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a\n",

      "in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no\n",

      "\n",
      "This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had\n",

      "Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He\n",
      "was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed\n",
      "to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a\n",
      "part.  He rather missed the 'petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a\n",
      "taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from\n",
      "strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls\n",
      "at home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very\n",
      "glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the\n",
      "representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she\n",
      "would confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other's society and\n",
      "were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice\n",
      "no one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while\n",
      "apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were\n",
      "half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each\n",
      "other.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in\n",
      "hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to\n",
      "please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he\n",
      "gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly\n",
      "women know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort\n",
      "of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as\n",
      "possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind\n",
      "word because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be\n",
      "generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she\n",
      "would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not\n",
      "change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the\n",

      "half-scornful surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at\n",

      "day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?\" he answered\n",

      "which were a weak point with Laurie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll go with pleasure.\" and he put out his hand for her\n",

      "Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\n",
      "downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\n",
      "himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\n",
      "fall asleep on his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\n",
      "was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an\n",

      "bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\n",
      "over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among\n",
      "the rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\n",
      "panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a\n",
      "capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with\n",
      "a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\n",
      "quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\n",
      "the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky\n",
      "foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\n",
      "fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\n",
      "Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer\n",
      "roses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust\n",
      "themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\n",
      "passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and\n",
      "feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\n",
      "seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool\n",
      "grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every\n",
      "fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\n",
      "smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\n",
      "the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\n",
      "the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,\n",
      "and the white-walled city on its shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?  Did you ever see such\n",

      "luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, nor felt such thorns,\" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\n",
      "mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\n",
      "grew just beyond his reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,\" said Amy,\n",
      "gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\n",
      "behind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he\n",
      "stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\n",
      "the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\n",
      "he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\n",
      "when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for\n",
      "romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\n",
      "red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones\n",
      "like that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him\n",
      "were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal\n",
      "wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for\n",
      "himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better\n",
      "of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard\n",
      "since he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,\" she\n",
      "said, thinking her speech amused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I will,\" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\n",
      "it in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?\" she asked presently,\n",
      "as she settled herself on a rustic seat.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Natural depravity, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natural indolence, you mean.  It's really dreadful!\" and Amy looked\n",
      "severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\n",
      "might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\n",
      "better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,\" and Laurie\n",
      "composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\n",

      "said Amy in her most energetic tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What delightful enthusiasm!\" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\n",
      "air of entire satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would Jo say if she saw you now?\" asked Amy impatiently, hoping\n",
      "to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy.  I'm busy!'\" He laughed as he spoke, but\n",
      "the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\n",
      "utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\n",
      "yet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\n",
      "before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\n",
      "Laurie's face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\n",
      "regret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless\n",
      "expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\n",
      "pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\n",
      "the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for\n",
      "he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,\" she\n",
      "said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wish I was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so\n",
      "changed, I sometimes think--\" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\n",
      "half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\n",
      "to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used\n",
      "to say it to her mother, \"It's all right, ma'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\n",
      "her lately.  It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\n",
      "cordial tone in which she said...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of that!  I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\n",
      "fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\n",
      "your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into\n",
      "some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of\n",
      "a foreign tour.  Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the\n",
      "grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in\n",
      "the sofa corner and told secrets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\n",
      "himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm all ready for the secrets.\" and he glanced up with a decided\n",
      "expression of interest in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've none to tell.  You may begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haven't one to bless myself with.  I thought perhaps you'd had some\n",
      "news from home..\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard all that has come lately.  Don't you hear often?  I\n",
      "fancied Jo would send you volumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's very busy.  I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\n",
      "you know.  When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?\" he\n",
      "asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\n",
      "had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never,\" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. \"Rome took\n",
      "all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt\n",
      "too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\n",
      "can make it so.  I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\n",
      "common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get\n",
      "the chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity\n",
      "becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation.  Laurie\n",
      "smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose\n",
      "when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!  And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\n",
      "downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, \"Now I'm going\n",
      "to play brother, and ask questions.  May I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't promise to answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your face will, if your tongue won't.  You aren't woman of the world\n",
      "enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.  I heard rumors about Fred\n",
      "and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if he had not been\n",
      "called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\n",
      "of it, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not for me to say,\" was Amy's grim reply, but her lips would\n",
      "smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed\n",
      "that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not engaged, I hope?\" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\n",
      "and grave all of a sudden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees,\n",
      "won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very likely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you are fond of old Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could be, if I tried.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul,\n",
      "what unearthly prudence!  He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I\n",
      "fancied you'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,\" began Amy,\n",
      "trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of\n",
      "herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand.  Queens of society can't get on without money, so you\n",
      "mean to make a good match, and start in that way?  Quite right and\n",
      "proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of\n",
      "your mother's girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True, nevertheless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\n",
      "contrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this\n",
      "instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of\n",
      "disappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as\n",
      "well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her\n",
      "resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,\" she said\n",
      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it for me, there's a dear girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could, if I tried.\" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\n",
      "the most summary style.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try, then.  I give you leave,\" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having\n",
      "someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd be angry in five minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm never angry with you.  It takes two flints to make a fire. You are\n",
      "as cool and soft as snow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\n",
      "applied rightly.  Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\n",
      "stirring up would prove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\n",
      "when his little wife beat him.  Regard me in the light of a husband or\n",
      "a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\n",
      "with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\n",
      "apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\n",
      "began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Flo and I have got a new name for you.  It's Lazy Laurence. How do you\n",
      "like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his\n",
      "head, with an imperturbable, \"That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pining to be told.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I despise you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had even said 'I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish tone, he\n",
      "would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,\n",
      "accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, if you please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are\n",
      "faulty, lazy, and miserable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strong language, mademoiselle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you like it, I'll go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray do, it's quite interesting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd find it so.  Selfish people always like to talk about\n",
      "themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I selfish?\" the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of\n",
      "surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very selfish,\" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as\n",
      "effective just then as an angry one.  \"I'll show you how, for I've\n",
      "studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with\n",
      "you.  Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but\n",
      "waste time and money and disappoint your friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't look as if you'd had much.  At any rate, you are none the\n",
      "better for it, as far as I can see.  I said when we first met that you\n",
      "had improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so\n",
      "nice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you\n",
      "like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to\n",
      "be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and\n",
      "respected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and\n",
      "beauty, ah you like that old Vanity!  But it's the truth, so I can't\n",
      "help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you\n",
      "can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you\n",
      "ought to be, you are only...\"  there she stopped, with a look that had\n",
      "both pain and pity in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saint Laurence on a gridiron,\" added Laurie, blandly finishing the\n",
      "sentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\n",
      "wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured\n",
      "expression replaced the former indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I supposed you'd take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say\n",
      "we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you\n",
      "good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your\n",
      "flattery is worth.\" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\n",
      "exasperating martyr at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\n",
      "and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, \"I\n",
      "will be good, oh, I will be good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the\n",
      "outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, \"Aren't you ashamed of a\n",
      "hand like that?  It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if\n",
      "it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers\n",
      "for ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see\n",
      "there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one\n",
      "Jo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough\n",
      "in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with\n",
      "a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his\n",
      "face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw\n",
      "his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a\n",
      "sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as\n",
      "if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in\n",
      "a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in\n",
      "Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.\n",
      "She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled\n",
      "the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the\n",
      "wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome\n",
      "hand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.\n",
      "Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the\n",
      "alteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when\n",
      "she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and\n",
      "kind when she chose to make it so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't\n",
      "the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.\n",
      "But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they\n",
      "should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps\n",
      "they would understand the change better than I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they would,\" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as\n",
      "touching as a broken one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,\n",
      "when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did\n",
      "like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!\" said artful Amy, wishing to\n",
      "be sure of her facts this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang Miss Randal!\" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\n",
      "that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg pardon, I thought...\" and there she paused diplomatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but\n",
      "Jo,\" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\n",
      "away as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came\n",
      "away, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn't be kind to you?  Why,\n",
      "I was sure she loved you dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her she\n",
      "didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It's\n",
      "her fault though, and you may tell her so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\n",
      "Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wrong, I didn't know.  I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I\n",
      "can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't, that's her name for me!\" and Laurie put up his hand with a\n",
      "quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,\n",
      "half-reproachful tone.  \"Wait till you've tried it yourself,\" he added\n",
      "in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,\" said\n",
      "Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,\n",
      "making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\n",
      "it down alone.  Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for\n",
      "the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\n",
      "failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if\n",
      "suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to\n",
      "sleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, \"Do you think Jo\n",
      "would despise me as you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don't you do\n",
      "something splendid, and make her love you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did my best, but it was no use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have\n",
      "done, for your grandfather's sake.  It would have been shameful to fail\n",
      "after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you\n",
      "could do well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,\" began Laurie,\n",
      "leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\n",
      "proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set\n",
      "about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self\n",
      "again, and forget your trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Try it and see.  You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much\n",
      "she knows about such things'.  I don't pretend to be wise, but I am\n",
      "observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine.  I'm\n",
      "interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and\n",
      "though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.\n",
      "Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for\n",
      "it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the\n",
      "one you want.  There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake\n",
      "up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring\n",
      "on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\n",
      "been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\n",
      "merely saying, \"How do you like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\n",
      "was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\n",
      "face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\n",
      "little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How well you draw!\" he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at\n",
      "her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, \"Yes, that's me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you are.  This is as you were.\" and Amy laid another sketch beside\n",
      "the one he held.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\n",
      "which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that\n",
      "a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked.  Only a\n",
      "rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and\n",
      "every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude\n",
      "was full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,\n",
      "stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot\n",
      "impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for\n",
      "the voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider's\n",
      "breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly\n",
      "arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that\n",

      "he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he\n",
      "might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and\n",

      "ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled\n",
      "state that winter.  He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and\n",

      "\"It's genius simmering, perhaps.  I'll let it simmer, and see what\n",
      "comes of it,\" he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it\n",
      "wasn't genius, but something far more common.  Whatever it was, it\n",
      "simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with\n",
      "his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go\n",
      "at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that\n",
      "everyone who loved music was not a composer.  Returning from one of\n",
      "Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he\n",
      "looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the\n",
      "busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back\n",
      "again.  Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as\n",
      "the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is right!  Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so.  That\n",
      "music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I\n",
      "won't be a humbug any longer.  Now what shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\n",
      "to work for his daily bread.  Now if ever, occurred an eligible\n",
      "opportunity for 'going to the devil', as he once forcibly expressed it,\n",
      "for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\n",
      "fond of providing employment for full and idle hands.  The poor fellow\n",
      "had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\n",
      "them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\n",
      "and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\n",
      "to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\n",
      "and say \"All's well,\" kept him safe and steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don't believe it, boys\n",

      "expect miracles.\"  I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true\n",
      "nevertheless.  Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\n",
      "that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\n",
      "refusing to echo such sayings.  Let the boys be boys, the longer the\n",
      "better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must.  But\n",

      "showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues\n",
      "which make men manliest in good women's eyes.  If it is a feminine\n",
      "delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the\n",

      "with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts of ours are\n",
      "curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\n",
      "spite of us.  Laurie's heart wouldn't ache.  The wound persisted in\n",
      "healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to\n",
      "forget, he found himself trying to remember.  He had not foreseen this\n",
      "turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it.  He was disgusted with\n",
      "himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture\n",
      "of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a\n",
      "tremendous blow so soon.  He carefully stirred up the embers of his\n",
      "lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze.  There was only a\n",
      "comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into\n",
      "a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish\n",
      "passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very\n",
      "tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass\n",

      "Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\n",

      "she--and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he\n",
      "did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of\n",
      "impatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one\n",
      "point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.  She was wrapped up in\n",
      "Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged\n",
      "him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of\n",
      "his heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him\n",
      "not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring\n",
      "and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That\n",

      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his\n",

      "Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and\n",
      "business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and\n",
      "in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up\n",
      "with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead\n",
      "roses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,\n",
      "Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them\n",
      "neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring\n",
      "thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the\n",
      "letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint\n",
      "Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not\n",
      "overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the\n",

      "The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\n",
      "was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\n",
      "manner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to\n",
      "and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie\n",
      "sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\n",
      "hoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go\n",
      "to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,\n",
      "for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made\n",
      "her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of 'our boy'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once\n",
      "decided to answer, \"Yes, thank you,\" but now she said, \"No, thank you,\"\n",
      "kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,\n",
      "and she found that something more than money and position was needed to\n",
      "satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes\n",
      "and fears.  The words, \"Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I\n",
      "fancied you would ever like,\" and Laurie's face when he uttered them,\n",
      "kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in\n",
      "look, if not in words, \"I shall marry for money.\"  It troubled her to\n",
      "remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so\n",
      "unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly\n",
      "creature.  She didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as\n",
      "she did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn't hate her for\n",
      "the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was\n",
      "kinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home\n",
      "letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when\n",
      "they did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,\n",
      "for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted\n",
      "in being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to\n",
      "love him.  It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and\n",
      "glad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act\n",
      "like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat\n",
      "him like a brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\n",
      "would be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never\n",
      "lectured now.  She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was\n",
      "interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,\n",
      "and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly\n",
      "confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.\n",
      "As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about\n",
      "in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when\n",
      "short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that\n",
      "Amy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did\n",
      "grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for\n",
      "society, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much\n",
      "to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while\n",
      "she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or\n",
      "absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight\n",
      "carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over\n",
      "his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a\n",
      "ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur\n",
      "according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether\n",
      "satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding\n",
      "denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\n",
      "she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\n",
      "Egypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\n",
      "said to himself, with a venerable air...\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\n",
      "duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter\n",
      "luxuriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.\n",
      "But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and\n",

      "Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of\n",
      "Genoa and the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly\n",
      "submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit,\n",
      "for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay,\n",
      "and let absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she\n",
      "longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake,\n",
      "waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,\n",
      "but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.  The moment\n",
      "he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow\n",
      "pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy\n",
      "and sorrow, hope and suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\n",
      "hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en\n",
      "pension.  The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to\n",
      "take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be\n",
      "in the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of\n",
      "sitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could\n",
      "not wait even a 'flash of time', and in the middle of the speech\n",

      "\n",
      "A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\n",
      "rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the\n",
      "tower falling far across the sunny water.  At one corner of the wide,\n",
      "low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or\n",
      "console herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here\n",
      "that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy\n",
      "eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did\n",
      "not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the\n",
      "archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood\n",
      "a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\n",
      "before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\n",
      "suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black\n",
      "ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her\n",
      "face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to\n",
      "Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only\n",
      "ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,\n",
      "they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for\n",
      "dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of\n",
      "unmistakable love and longing...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood\n",
      "together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\n",
      "protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\n",
      "sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\n",
      "woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy.  He\n",
      "did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the\n",
      "truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,\n",
      "Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\n",
      "well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.\n",
      "As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at\n",
      "the recollection of her impulsive greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\n",

      "you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...\"  He\n",
      "could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,\n",
      "and did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy's head down\n",
      "on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,\n",
      "so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was\n",
      "better than words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't say anything, this comforts me,\" she said softly.  \"Beth\n",
      "is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread the going\n",
      "home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for\n",

      "\n",
      "Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that\n",

      "about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,\" he said,\n",
      "in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied\n",
      "on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\n",
      "sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon\n",
      "his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,\n",
      "a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully\n",
      "for her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\n",
      "expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\n",
      "the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\n",
      "their words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked\n",
      "and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\n",
      "gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell\n",
      "warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\n",
      "sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated\n",

      "never thought of such a thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\n",
      "no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged\n",
      "Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\n",
      "solitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal\n",
      "occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it\n",
      "with more than her usual success.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was\n",
      "never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the\n",
      "most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed\n",
      "his example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was\n",
      "owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\n",
      "like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\n",
      "wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get\n",
      "clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.\n",
      "The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and\n",
      "moody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of\n",
      "aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to\n",
      "wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look\n",
      "benignly down upon them saying, \"Little children, love one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\n",

      "while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he\n",
      "had firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for\n",
      "the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the\n",
      "same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\n",
      "impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His\n",

      "impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the\n",
      "burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she\n",

      "her pocket.  But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was only a\n",
      "struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out\n",
      "her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood\n",
      "suggested.  It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do\n",

      "found the helps I have suggested.  Still another was given her, and she\n",
      "took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the\n",

      "much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her\n",
      "utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.\n",
      "Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the\n",
      "appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as\n",
      "well as friends admired it.  For a small thing it was a great success,\n",

      "lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to\n",

      "her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new\n",

      "Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the\n",
      "fire, and thinking.  It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\n",
      "dusk.  No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little\n",
      "red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\n",
      "thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.  Her face looked\n",
      "tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she\n",
      "was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and\n",
      "how little she seemed to have accomplished.  Almost twenty-five, and\n",
      "nothing to show for it.  Jo was mistaken in that.  There was a good\n",
      "deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An old maid, that's what I'm to be.  A literary spinster, with a pen\n",
      "for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence\n",
      "a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I'm old and can't\n",
      "enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.\n",
      "Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,\n",
      "old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but...\" and\n",
      "there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to\n",
      "five-and-twenty.  But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can get on\n",
      "quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon.  At\n",
      "twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\n",
      "resolve that they never will be.  At thirty they say nothing about it,\n",
      "but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by\n",
      "remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\n",
      "they may be learning to grow old gracefully.  Don't laugh at the\n",
      "spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are\n",
      "hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\n",
      "and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,\n",
      "make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight.  Even the sad, sour\n",
      "sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the\n",
      "sweetest part of life, if for no other reason.  And looking at them\n",
      "with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember\n",
      "that they too may miss the blossom time.  That rosy cheeks don't last\n",
      "forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and\n",
      "that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and\n",
      "admiration now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\n",
      "how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\n",
      "which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\n",
      "and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color.  Just recollect\n",
      "the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\n",
      "petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out\n",
      "of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches\n",
      "the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old\n",
      "feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little\n",
      "attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.  The\n",
      "bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all\n",
      "the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part\n",
      "mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a\n",
      "tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who\n",
      "has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for 'the best nevvy\n",
      "in the world'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\n",
      "little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before her,\n",
      "a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he\n",
      "used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show it.  But,\n",
      "like Jenny in the ballad...\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"She could not think it he,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\n",
      "kissed her.  Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh my Teddy!  Oh my Teddy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Glad!  My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your mother has got her down at Meg's.  We stopped there by the way,\n",
      "and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your what?\" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\n",
      "unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the dickens!  Now I've done it,\" and he looked so guilty that Jo\n",
      "was down on him like a flash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've gone and got married!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, please, but I never will again,\" and he went down upon his knees,\n",
      "with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,\n",
      "and triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Actually married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much so, thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us.  What dreadful thing will you do next?\" and Jo fell into\n",
      "her seat with a gasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,\"\n",
      "returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\n",
      "a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\n",
      "ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\n",
      "barricade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\n",
      "the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, \"The old pillow is\n",
      "up garret, and we don't need it now.  So, come and 'fess, Teddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that\n",
      "but you,\" and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does Amy call you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's like her.  Well, you look it,\" and Jo's eye plainly betrayed\n",
      "that she found her boy comelier than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural\n",
      "one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart.  Both felt it, and\n",
      "for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a\n",
      "little shadow over them.  It was gone directly however, for Laurie\n",
      "said, with a vain attempt at dignity...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit, and you never will.  You've grown bigger and bonnier, but\n",
      "you are the same scapegrace as ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,\" began\n",
      "Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so\n",
      "irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!\" answered Jo, smiling all\n",
      "over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then\n",
      "settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all\n",
      "coming up presently.  I couldn't wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell\n",
      "you the grand surprise, and have 'first skim' as we used to say when we\n",
      "squabbled about the cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong\n",
      "end.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I did it to please Amy,\" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\n",
      "Jo exclaim...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,\n",
      "if you can, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now she's beginning to marm it.  Isn't it jolly to hear her?\" said\n",
      "Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\n",
      "agreed.  \"It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned\n",
      "to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\n",
      "changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But\n",
      "Grandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn't let\n",
      "him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got\n",
      "English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy\n",
      "come with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be\n",
      "married, and then we can do as we like'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not always,\" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\n",
      "of good reasons on our side.  There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\n",
      "but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only\n",
      "'taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?\"\n",
      "interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\n",
      "delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been\n",
      "so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I can't help\n",
      "being proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play\n",
      "propriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use\n",
      "apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all\n",
      "round, so we did it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When, where, how?\" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and\n",
      "curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet\n",
      "wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear\n",
      "little Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the\n",
      "little red pillow, which he remembered well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you let us know afterward?\" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,\n",
      "when they had sat quite still a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,\n",
      "at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found\n",
      "he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend\n",
      "our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular\n",
      "honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but\n",
      "once in their lives. My faith!  Wasn't it love among the roses!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the\n",
      "fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured\n",
      "her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away\n",
      "her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the\n",
      "half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly\n",
      "gravity she had never seen in him before...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever.\n",
      "As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to\n",
      "me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have\n",
      "learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places\n",
      "in my heart, that's all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have\n",
      "come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I\n",
      "never could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,\n",
      "headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my\n",
      "mistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after\n",
      "making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,\n",
      "at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and\n",
      "tried to love you both alike.  But I couldn't, and when I saw her in\n",
      "Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got\n",
      "into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the\n",
      "old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my\n",
      "heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you\n",
      "believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one\n",
      "another?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy\n",
      "and girl again.  The happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't\n",
      "expect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for\n",
      "playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I'm sure you feel\n",
      "this.  I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.  I shall miss\n",
      "my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because\n",
      "he means to be what I hoped he would.  We can't be little playmates any\n",
      "longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another\n",
      "all our lives, won't we, Laurie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\n",
      "face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\n",
      "passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\n",
      "both.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming\n",
      "home to be a sad one, \"I can't make it true that you children are\n",
      "really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only\n",
      "yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair\n",
      "when you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so\n",
      "like a grandma.  I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as Peggotty\n",
      "said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a\n",
      "precocious infant,\" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\n",
      "feeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a\n",
      "hard one that I feel forty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\n",
      "are older.  Here's a line, and there's another.  Unless you smile, your\n",
      "eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\n",
      "on it.  You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\n",
      "What a selfish beast I've been!\" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\n",
      "remorseful look.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone\n",
      "which she tried to make more cheerful, \"No, I had Father and Mother to\n",
      "help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you\n",
      "and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.\n",
      "I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You never shall be again,\" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\n",
      "as if to fence out every human ill.  \"Amy and I can't get on without\n",
      "you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go\n",
      "halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and\n",
      "all be blissfully happy and friendly together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to\n",
      "feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly\n",
      "away when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,\" and Jo leaned\n",
      "her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill\n",
      "and Laurie told her to hold on to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was\n",
      "smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and\n",
      "laughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like angels!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course, but which rules?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think\n",
      "so, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for\n",
      "marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your\n",
      "life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind\n",
      "much.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I\n",
      "rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and\n",
      "prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you\n",
      "a favor all the while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying\n",
      "it!\" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with\n",
      "masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his \"high and\n",
      "mighty\" air, \"Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of\n",
      "man to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another\n",
      "too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy\n",
      "seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She\n",
      "is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man\n",
      "best, you remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She can blow him up as well as shine on him,\" laughed Laurie. \"Such a\n",
      "lecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than\n",
      "any of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I'll tell you all about it\n",
      "sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised\n",
      "and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and\n",
      "married the good-for-nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I look as if I needed it, don't I?\" said Laurie, getting up and\n",

      "rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, \"Where is she? Where's my\n",
      "dear old Jo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all\n",
      "over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were\n",
      "set down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and\n",
      "hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign\n",
      "tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the\n",
      "old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier\n",
      "than ever.  It was good to see him beam at 'my children', as he called\n",
      "the young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly\n",
      "duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,\n",
      "to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying\n",
      "the pretty picture they made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own\n",
      "dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely\n",
      "eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that 'her ladyship' was altogether\n",
      "a most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the\n",
      "pair, \"How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found\n",
      "the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than\n",
      "clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.\"  Mrs. March and\n",
      "her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they\n",
      "saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but\n",
      "the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a\n",
      "peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,\n",
      "prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and\n",
      "winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of\n",
      "her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for\n",
      "it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true\n",
      "gentlewoman she had hoped to become.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Love has done much for our little girl,\" said her mother softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,\" Mr.\n",
      "March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head\n",
      "beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her 'pitty aunty', but\n",
      "attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of\n",
      "delightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\n",
      "he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took\n",
      "the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank\n",
      "movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew\n",
      "where to have him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\n",
      "hit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,\" and\n",
      "with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\n",
      "in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\n",
      "his boyish soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin'\n",
      "sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\n",
      "calling little Amy 'Mis.  Laurence!'\" muttered old Hannah, who could\n",
      "not resist frequent \"peeks\" through the slide as she set the table in a\n",
      "most decidedly promiscuous manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\n",
      "burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half\n",
      "an hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\n",
      "provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\n",
      "had gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into\n",
      "the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.\n",
      "March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'. The old gentleman took\n",
      "Jo, with a whispered, \"You must be my girl now,\" and a glance at the\n",
      "empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, \"I'll try to fill\n",
      "her place, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\n",
      "everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at\n",
      "their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\n",
      "opportunity.  Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad\n",
      "libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't\n",
      "they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,\n",
      "there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human\n",
      "nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness\n",
      "of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would\n",
      "pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,\n",
      "the little sinners attached themselves to 'Dranpa', who hadn't his\n",
      "spectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned\n",
      "to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm.  The others paired off as\n",
      "before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind\n",
      "it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver\n",
      "dishes that's stored away over yander?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,\n",
      "and wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too\n",
      "good for her,\" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?\"\n",
      "asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care,\" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\n",
      "uncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party\n",
      "vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\n",
      "stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\n",
      "looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\n",
      "for even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift\n",
      "was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\n",
      "herself, \"I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be\n",
      "dismal now.\"  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her\n",
      "boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had\n",
      "just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\n",
      "come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming\n",
      "on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!\" cried Jo, with a clutch, as\n",
      "if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,\" and the Professor\n",
      "paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we haven't, only the family.  My sister and friends have just come\n",
      "home, and we are all very happy.  Come in, and make one of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\n",
      "away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the\n",
      "door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\n",
      "something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\n",
      "and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\n",
      "man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.\n",
      "You haf been ill, my friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\n",
      "fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you\n",
      "last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,\" and he\n",
      "shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\n",
      "comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\n",
      "warm hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,\" she said, with a\n",
      "face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might\n",
      "as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\n",
      "rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted\n",
      "him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for\n",
      "his own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that\n",
      "opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,\n",
      "feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty\n",
      "enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly\n",
      "hospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a\n",
      "traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself\n",
      "at home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and\n",
      "establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by\n",
      "rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,\n",
      "with juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one\n",
      "another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,\n",
      "opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John\n",
      "listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence\n",
      "found it impossible to go to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\n",
      "amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\n",
      "suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\n",
      "the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\n",
      "He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn\n",
      "into the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\n",
      "and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at\n",
      "him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting\n",
      "his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his\n",
      "eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered\n",
      "the mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take\n",
      "care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept\n",
      "them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\n",
      "after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several\n",
      "propitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded\n",
      "expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,\n",
      "actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him\n",
      "with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.\n",
      "Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the\n",
      "ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be\n",
      "considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when\n",
      "Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she\n",
      "watched her father's absorbed face, \"How he would enjoy having such a\n",
      "man as my Professor to talk with every day!\"  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was\n",
      "dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a\n",
      "gentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,\n",
      "but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it\n",
      "up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect\n",
      "better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a\n",
      "Jove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she\n",
      "sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even\n",
      "the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his\n",
      "immaculate wristbands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old fellow!  He couldn't have got himself up with more care if\n",
      "he'd been going a-wooing,\" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden\n",
      "thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to\n",
      "drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for\n",
      "though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor\n",
      "dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\n",
      "little blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\n",
      "saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\n",
      "resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted\n",
      "the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\n",
      "Laurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking\n",
      "away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\n",
      "mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\n",
      "bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of\n",
      "matches, made a move to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\n",
      "again once more,\" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe\n",
      "and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or\n",
      "untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\n",
      "invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\n",
      "household league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in\n",
      "its old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left\n",
      "unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its accustomed\n",
      "shelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,\n",
      "and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,\n",
      "looked down upon them, seeming to say, \"Be happy.  I am here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,\" said\n",
      "Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, \"Not\n",
      "tonight, dear.  I can't show off tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she\n",
      "sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best\n",
      "master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts with a\n",
      "sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The\n",
      "room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last\n",
      "line of Beth's favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...\n",
      "\n",
      "    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;\n",
      "\n",
      "and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\n",
      "her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,\"\n",
      "said Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his\n",
      "throat with a gratified \"Hem!\" as he stepped into the corner where Jo\n",
      "stood, saying...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a\n",
      "grasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\n",
      "whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\n",
      "It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\n",
      "and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might\n",
      "listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,\n",
      "\n",
      "used to be the Professor's favorite line, for 'das land' meant Germany\n",
      "to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\n",
      "upon the words...\n",
      "\n",
      "    There, oh there, might I with thee,\n",
      "    O, my beloved, go\n",
      "\n",
      "and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\n",
      "longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\n",
      "whenever he liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\n",
      "with laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\n",
      "entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been\n",
      "introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called her by her new\n",
      "name since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,\n",
      "in his most gracious manner, at parting...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that\n",
      "there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\n",

      "delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\n",

      "into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove\n",
      "to him that I'm not spoiled.  I need something of the sort to keep me\n",

      "\"And Amy, what is she going to do?\" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\n",

      "exert over the world at large.  That's about it, isn't it, Madame\n",
      "Recamier?\" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time will show.  Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by\n",
      "calling me names before their faces,\" answered Amy, resolving that\n",

      "as a queen of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How happy those children seem together!\" observed Mr. March, finding\n",
      "it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple\n",
      "had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and I think it will last,\" added Mrs. March, with the restful\n",
      "expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it will.  Happy Amy!\" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\n",

      "Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\n",

      "richer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\n",
      "one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\n",
      "Women never should marry for money...\" Amy caught herself up short as\n",
      "the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\n",
      "malicious gravity...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\n",
      "to do it sometimes.  If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\n",
      "duty to make a rich match.  That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\n",
      "good-for-nothing like me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that!  I forgot you were rich\n",
      "when I said 'Yes'.  I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I\n",
      "sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.\"\n",
      "And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,\n",
      "gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\n",
      "once, do you?  It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Am I an idiot and a brute?  How could I think so, when you refused a\n",

      "have the right?  Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to\n",
      "think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and\n",
      "though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the\n",
      "daughter was true to the mother's teaching.  I told Mamma so yesterday,\n",
      "and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a\n",
      "million, to be spent in charity.  You are not listening to my moral\n",
      "remarks, Mrs. Laurence,\" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an\n",
      "absent look, though fixed upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.  I\n",

      "handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is\n",
      "such a comfort to me,\" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\n",
      "with artistic satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\n",
      "suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his\n",
      "wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, \"May I ask you a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's the trouble is it?  I thought there was something in the\n",

      "the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding\n",
      "with a heart as light as my heels.  Do you doubt it, my darling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.  Her little jealous fear\n",
      "vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't\n",
      "we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in\n",
      "Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?\" said Laurie, when they\n",
      "began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they\n",
      "were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.  She is very proud of him,\n",

      "beautiful thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless her dear heart!  She won't think so when she has a literary\n",

      "won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in\n",
      "spite of themselves.  I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we?  There's one sort of\n",
      "poverty that I particularly like to help.  Out-and-out beggars get\n",
      "taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't\n",
      "ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand\n",
      "ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that\n",
      "it does not offend.  I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman\n",
      "better than a blarnerying beggar.  I suppose it's wrong, but I do,\n",
      "though it is harder.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I\n",
      "was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good\n",
      "many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and\n",
      "enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid\n",
      "fellows, some of them, working like heros,  poor and friendless, but so\n",
      "full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,\n",
      "and longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it's\n",
      "a satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be\n",
      "allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of\n",
      "fuel to keep the pot boiling.  If they haven't, it's a pleasure to\n",
      "comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it\n",
      "out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer\n",
      "in silence.  I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you\n",
      "made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old\n",
      "story.  Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see\n",
      "youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a\n",
      "little help at the right minute.  People have been very kind to me, and\n",
      "whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put\n",
      "out my hand and help them, as I was helped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!\" cried Laurie, resolving,\n",
      "with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution\n",
      "for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies.  \"Rich\n",
      "people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their\n",
      "money accumulate for others to waste.  It's not half so sensible to\n",
      "leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while\n",
      "alive, and enjoy making one's fellow creatures happy with it.  We'll\n",
      "have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure\n",
      "by giving other people a generous taste.  Will you be a little Dorcas,\n",

      "of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert\n",

      "early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and\n",
      "distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw,\n",
      "and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his 'sewinsheen', a\n",
      "mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for\n",

      "tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\n",
      "aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her\n",
      "brother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,\n",

      "be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\n",

      "ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead.  The fact that a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I didn't.  I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we\n",

      "betraying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "matter now what became of her clothes or herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read\n",

      "therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and\n",
      "manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was\n",
      "in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When\n",
      "she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help\n",
      "suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered\n",
      "her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but\n",
      "when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply\n",
      "that despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost\n",
      "clapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his\n",
      "destination, she said, \"So far away!\" in a tone of despair that lifted\n",
      "him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down\n",
      "again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won't take\n",

      "Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\n",
      "particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and\n",
      "dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the\n",
      "flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of\n",
      "needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut off,\n",
      "gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for\n",
      "lavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching\n",
      "her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed\n",
      "to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,\n",
      "like dreams, go by contraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more\n",
      "cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather\n",
      "enjoyed it on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\n",
      "haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so\n",

      "flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will we buy?\" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,\n",
      "and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they\n",
      "went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May they haf oranges and figs?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They eat them when they can get them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you care for nuts?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy\n",
      "a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done\n",
      "with it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,\n",
      "and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of\n",
      "rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of\n",
      "a demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and\n",
      "giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\n",
      "traveled on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,\" began the Professor,\n",
      "after a moist promenade of half a block.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir?\" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he\n",
      "would hear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time\n",
      "remains to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden\n",
      "squeeze she gave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go\n",
      "alone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had\n",
      "stepped into a refrigerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and\n",
      "the husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\n",
      "friendly thing to take the little mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.\"  \"I'm going very fast, and he's\n",
      "getting dearer every minute,\" added Jo to herself, then with a mental\n",
      "shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to\n",
      "behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\n",
      "then ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,\n",
      "condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\n",
      "shopping for their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lady may prefer this.  It's a superior article, a most desirable\n",
      "color, quite chaste and genteel,\" he said, shaking out a comfortable\n",
      "gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?\" she asked, turning her back to him,\n",
      "and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excellently well, we will haf it,\" answered the Professor, smiling to\n",
      "himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\n",
      "like a confirmed bargain-hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now shall we go home?\" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's late, and I'm _so_ tired.\" Jo's voice was more pathetic than\n",
      "she knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it\n",
      "came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the\n",
      "first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and\n",
      "that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the\n",
      "latter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,\n",
      "it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this\n",
      "idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty\n",
      "gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not our omniboos,\" said the Professor, waving the loaded\n",
      "vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\n",

      "I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?\n",

      "in one breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!\" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\n",
      "hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that\n",
      "plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,\n",
      "even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he\n",

      "It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had\n",

      "account of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except\n",
      "figuratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender\n",
      "remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only\n",
      "way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an\n",
      "expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there\n",
      "actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his\n",
      "beard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have\n",
      "done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a\n",
      "deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her\n",
      "bonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most\n",
      "beautiful woman living, and she found him more \"Jove-like\" than ever,\n",
      "though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling\n",
      "thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and\n",
      "every finger of his gloves needed mending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\n",
      "entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\n",
      "of deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for\n",
      "they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\n",
      "life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\n",
      "plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of\n",
      "heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the\n",
      "world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo\n",
      "trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and\n",
      "wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she\n",
      "was the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sentimental? Yes.  Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and\n",
      "keep ourselves young mit it.  Your English 'you' is so cold, say\n",

      "goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to\n",
      "thee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said 'Yes', then, if I had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had\n",

      "rich, that he'll never be.  Money doesn't stay in his pocket long\n",

      "me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least I feel so, and we\n",
      "can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.\n",
      "It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture\n",
      "strong and plain.  There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and\n",
      "splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.\n",
      "Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach\n",
      "in his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet\n",
      "and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I've always longed for\n",
      "lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and\n",

      "As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\n",
      "into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\n",

      "people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've\n",
      "seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones\n",
      "pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.  Some are naughty through\n",

      "have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they\n",
      "need most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them\n",
      "about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at\n",
      "once from pretty children into fine young men.  They don't complain\n",
      "much--plucky little souls--but they feel it.  I've been through\n",
      "something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in\n",
      "such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,\n",
      "well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the\n",
      "topsy-turvy heads.  I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up\n",
      "one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll testify that you tried to do it,\" said Laurie with a grateful\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,\n",
      "sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying\n",
      "up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not\n",
      "merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them\n",

      "Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I say, Jo, that's rather too much,\" he began, just in his old boyish\n",
      "way.  \"You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\n",
      "except by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me\n",
      "off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if\n",
      "I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it,\" and he laid one\n",
      "hand gently on his grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden\n",
      "one, for the three were never far apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\n",
      "world!\" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind\n",
      "just then.  \"When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as\n",
      "the three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only\n",
      "here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,\" she added more\n",
      "quietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful\n",
      "evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of\n",
      "happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed\n",
      "always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\n",
      "in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew\n",
      "where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then\n",
      "a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\n",
      "surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was\n",
      "continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\n",
      "Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\n",
      "its support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,\n",
      "and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but\n",
      "the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\n",
      "rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\n",
      "'wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\n",
      "had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\n",
      "Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!  There was a sort of\n",
      "poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the\n",
      "terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely\n",
      "on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,\n",
      "and played cricket in the big field where the irritable 'cow with a\n",
      "crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed.  It\n",
      "became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be\n",
      "called the 'Bhaer-garten', as a compliment to its master and\n",
      "appropriate to its inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a\n",
      "fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--'a happy, homelike\n",
      "place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'.  Every room\n",
      "in the big house was soon full.  Every little plot in the garden soon\n",
      "had its owner.  A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet\n",
      "animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz\n",
      "from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy\n",
      "young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding\n",
      "words, and grateful hearts, full of love for 'Mother Bhaer'.  She had\n",
      "boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,\n",
      "by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin\n",
      "much trouble and anxiety.  But her faith in the good spot which exists\n",
      "in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little\n",
      "ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal\n",
      "boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as\n",
      "benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times\n",
      "seven.  Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their\n",
      "penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching\n",
      "little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even\n",
      "their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.\n",
      "There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,\n",
      "boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a\n",
      "merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was\n",
      "welcome to the 'Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted that his\n",
      "admission would ruin the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much\n",
      "anxiety, and a perpetual racket.  She enjoyed it heartily and found the\n",
      "applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for\n",
      "now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\n",
      "and admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\n",
      "increase her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a\n",
      "happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny\n",
      "temper as well as his mother's lively spirit.  How they ever grew up\n",
      "alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and\n",
      "aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough\n",
      "nurses loved and served them well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most\n",
      "delightful was the yearly apple-picking.  For then the Marches,\n",
      "Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day\n",
      "of it.  Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals\n",
      "occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\n",
      "exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance\n",
      "healthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.\n",
      "Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped\n",
      "briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\n",
      "feast.  Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.  Birds\n",
      "twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree\n",
      "stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the\n",
      "first shake.  Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed\n",
      "up and tumbled down.  Everybody declared that there never had been such\n",
      "a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave\n",
      "themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there\n",
      "were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and\n",
      "Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentle apple's winey juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout\n",
      "Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made\n",
      "a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the\n",
      "way of ground and lofty tumbling.  Laurie devoted himself to the little\n",
      "ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among\n",
      "the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck.\n",
      "Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,\n",
      "sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a\n",
      "beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups,\n",
      "and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little\n",
      "crutch beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned\n",
      "up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her\n",
      "arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up.  Little Teddy\n",
      "bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never\n",
      "felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,\n",
      "galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by\n",
      "his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies\n",
      "could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and\n",
      "their own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in\n",
      "time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back\n",
      "with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while\n",
      "the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and\n",
      "Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the\n",
      "grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.\n",
      "The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for\n",
      "the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of\n",
      "refreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the\n",
      "boyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the\n",
      "fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk\n",
      "while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by\n",
      "eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over\n",
      "the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of\n",
      "bird.  The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among\n",
      "the edibles at his own sweet will.\n",
      "\n",
      "When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first\n",
      "regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--\"Aunt March, God\n",
      "bless her!\"  A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot\n",
      "how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been\n",
      "taught to keep her memory green.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday!  Long life to her, with three times\n",
      "three!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering\n",
      "once begun, it was hard to stop it.  Everybody's health was proposed,\n",
      "from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\n",
      "astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search\n",
      "of its young master.  Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented\n",
      "the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\n",
      "transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,\n",
      "some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were\n",
      "ornaments to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were all their own.\n",
      "Every stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the\n",
      "handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.\n",
      "Demi's miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut,\n",
      "Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was\n",
      "soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so\n",
      "fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--\"To dear\n",
      "Grandma, from her little Beth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when\n",
      "Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while\n",
      "Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to\n",
      "sing.  Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and\n",
      "from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys\n",
      "sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie\n",
      "set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best\n",
      "effect.  This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand\n",
      "success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on\n",
      "shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz\n",
      "and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\n",
      "her daughters under the festival tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'unlucky Jo' again, when my\n",
      "greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\" said Mrs. Bhaer,\n",
      "taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was\n",
      "rapturously churning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\n",
      "ago.  Do you remember our castles in the air?\" asked Amy, smiling as\n",
      "she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear fellows!  It does my heart good to see them forget business and\n",
      "frolic for a day,\" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\n",
      "mankind.  \"Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,\n",
      "lonely, and cold to me now.  I haven't given up the hope that I may\n",
      "write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the\n",
      "better for such experiences and illustrations as these,\" and Jo pointed\n",
      "from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\n",
      "Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\n",
      "of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her\n",
      "mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in\n",
      "her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face\n",
      "which never could grow old to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My castle was the most nearly realized of all.  I asked for splendid\n",
      "things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\n",
      "had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.  I've\n",
      "got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,\" and\n",
      "Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender\n",
      "and devout content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter\n",
      "it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or\n",
      "confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty.  I've\n",
      "begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\n",
      "I've ever done.  I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so\n",
      "that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little\n",
      "angel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\n",
      "child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\n",
      "creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's\n",
      "sunshine.  This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for\n",
      "one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was\n",
      "growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.  Laurie was growing more\n",
      "serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,\n",
      "good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and\n",
      "sorrow, from the most blessed for ...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    Into each life some rain must fall,\n",
      "    Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.  Don't despond, but\n",
      "hope and keep happy,\" said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped\n",
      "from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie\n",
      "to take more than half of every burden,\" replied Amy warmly.  \"He never\n",
      "lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so\n",
      "devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can't\n",
      "love him enough.  So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg,\n",
      "'Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I'm far\n",
      "happier than I deserve,\" added Jo, glancing from her good husband to\n",
      "her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her.  \"Fritz is\n",
      "getting gray and stout.  I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am\n",
      "thirty.  We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,\n",
      "for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under\n",
      "the bed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already.\n",
      "But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,\n",
      "and never was so jolly in my life.  Excuse the remark, but living among\n",
      "boys, I can't help using their expressions now and then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,\" began Mrs. March,\n",
      "frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of\n",
      "countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not half so good as yours, Mother.  Here it is, and we never can thank\n",
      "you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,\" cried Jo,\n",
      "with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,\" said Amy\n",
      "softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee\n",
      "dear,\" added Meg's tender voice.\n",
      "\n",

      "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\n",
      "of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\n",
      "first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\n",
      "of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\n",
      "property of some one or other of their daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\n",
      "Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\n",
      "told me all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was invitation enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\n",
      "by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\n",
      "down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\n",
      "delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\n",
      "to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\n",
      "in the house by the end of next week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is his name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bingley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he married or single?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four\n",
      "or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\n",
      "must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n",
      "_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\n",
      "soon as he comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\n",
      "them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\n",
      "as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\n",
      "party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\n",
      "I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\n",
      "five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\n",
      "beauty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\n",
      "the neighbourhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\n",
      "be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\n",
      "merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\n",
      "comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\n",
      "him, if you do not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\n",
      "glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\n",
      "hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\n",
      "I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\n",
      "others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\n",
      "good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\n",
      "preference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\n",
      "all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\n",
      "quickness than her sisters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\n",
      "delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\n",
      "are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\n",
      "these twenty years at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\n",
      "thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\n",
      "visit them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\n",
      "all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n",
      "reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\n",
      "been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\n",
      "was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\n",
      "little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\n",
      "fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\n",
      "daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\n",
      "had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\n",
      "wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\n",
      "paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\n",
      "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\n",
      "suddenly addressed her with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\n",
      "resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\n",
      "assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\n",
      "of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\n",
      "of her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\n",
      "not depend on her serving you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain\n",
      "herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little\n",
      "compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\n",
      "them ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back\n",
      "till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\n",
      "for she will not know him herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\n",
      "Mr. Bingley to _her_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\n",
      "myself; how can you be so teazing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\n",
      "very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\n",
      "fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\n",
      "all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as\n",
      "she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\n",
      "take it on myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\n",
      "nonsense!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\n",
      "you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\n",
      "them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\n",
      "Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great\n",
      "books, and make extracts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I\n",
      "had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\n",
      "him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\n",
      "cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\n",
      "was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\n",
      "while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n",
      "persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n",
      "neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\n",
      "good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said\n",
      "a word about it till now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\n",
      "as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an excellent father you have, girls,\" said she, when the door was\n",
      "shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\n",
      "or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\n",
      "pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but\n",
      "for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\n",
      "the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\n",
      "ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n",
      "youngest, I'm the tallest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\n",
      "return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\n",
      "daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her\n",
      "husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\n",
      "in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\n",
      "distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\n",
      "last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour\n",
      "Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\n",
      "delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\n",
      "agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\n",
      "with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\n",
      "dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\n",
      "hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well\n",
      "married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten\n",
      "minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\n",
      "admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\n",
      "much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\n",
      "fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\n",
      "window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\n",
      "housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\n",
      "was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\n",
      "accept the honour of their invitation, &c. Mrs. Bennet was quite\n",
      "disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\n",
      "so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\n",
      "he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\n",
      "settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\n",
      "little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a\n",
      "large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\n",
      "was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\n",
      "The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the\n",
      "day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought\n",
      "only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when\n",
      "the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five\n",
      "altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\n",
      "another young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant\n",
      "countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\n",
      "with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\n",
      "looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\n",
      "of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and\n",
      "the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after\n",
      "his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\n",
      "pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\n",
      "much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\n",
      "admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\n",
      "which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\n",
      "proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\n",
      "large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\n",
      "forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\n",
      "with his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\n",
      "people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\n",
      "was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\n",
      "himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\n",
      "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\n",
      "only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\n",
      "introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\n",
      "walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\n",
      "His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\n",
      "the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.\n",
      "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\n",
      "his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his\n",
      "having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\n",
      "down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\n",
      "standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\n",
      "Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his\n",
      "friend to join it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\n",
      "standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\n",
      "dance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\n",
      "particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\n",
      "would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\n",
      "another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to\n",
      "stand up with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Bingley, \"for a\n",
      "kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\n",
      "life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\n",
      "uncommonly pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\n",
      "of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\n",
      "dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round, he looked for a moment at\n",
      "Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,\n",
      "\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\n",
      "humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\n",
      "by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\n",
      "smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\n",
      "remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story\n",
      "however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\n",
      "playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\n",
      "party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\n",
      "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\n",
      "mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\n",
      "pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n",
      "accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\n",
      "fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\n",
      "had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good\n",
      "spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\n",
      "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\n",
      "book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n",
      "good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\n",
      "such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's\n",
      "views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\n",
      "had a very different story to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\n",
      "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\n",
      "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well\n",
      "she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\n",
      "her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her\n",
      "twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\n",
      "time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\n",
      "up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody\n",
      "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\n",
      "down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n",
      "asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\n",
      "King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\n",
      "again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\n",
      "\"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of\n",
      "his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He\n",
      "is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\n",
      "in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\n",
      "lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\n",
      "description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\n",
      "of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\n",
      "exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\n",
      "suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\n",
      "all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\n",
      "him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\n",
      "great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\n",
      "dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER IV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\n",
      "her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\n",
      "she admired him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible, good\n",
      "humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,\n",
      "with such perfect good breeding!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\n",
      "likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\n",
      "did not expect such a compliment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\n",
      "us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\n",
      "could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\n",
      "seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\n",
      "the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\n",
      "very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\n",
      "stupider person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Lizzy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.\n",
      "You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable\n",
      "in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak\n",
      "what I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\n",
      "good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\n",
      "others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every\n",
      "where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\n",
      "of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of\n",
      "the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,\n",
      "do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\n",
      "converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep\n",
      "his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\n",
      "neighbour in her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\n",
      "the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\n",
      "quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\n",
      "with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very\n",
      "little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not\n",
      "deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\n",
      "being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were\n",
      "rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private\n",
      "seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the\n",
      "habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\n",
      "of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\n",
      "themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\n",
      "the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\n",
      "memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been\n",
      "acquired by trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred\n",
      "thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\n",
      "but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\n",
      "sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\n",
      "good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\n",
      "who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\n",
      "remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\n",
      "purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\n",
      "though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\n",
      "means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\n",
      "married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\n",
      "his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\n",
      "age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to\n",
      "look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an\n",
      "hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\n",
      "with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\n",
      "great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\n",
      "easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\n",
      "offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\n",
      "appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the\n",
      "firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\n",
      "understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,\n",
      "but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\n",
      "fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In\n",
      "that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of\n",
      "being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\n",
      "characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\n",
      "girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,\n",
      "there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted\n",
      "with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\n",
      "more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\n",
      "in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\n",
      "felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\n",
      "pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too\n",
      "much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\n",
      "her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\n",
      "they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\n",
      "established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such\n",
      "commendation to think of her as he chose.\n",

      "\n",
      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\n",
      "were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\n",
      "in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the\n",
      "honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.\n",
      "The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\n",
      "disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and\n",
      "quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a\n",
      "mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\n",
      "could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by\n",
      "business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For\n",
      "though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\n",
      "contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,\n",
      "friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him\n",
      "courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\n",
      "valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The\n",
      "eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,\n",
      "was Elizabeth's intimate friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\n",
      "ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\n",
      "brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil\n",
      "self-command to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be\n",
      "sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\n",
      "_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\n",
      "about Mr. Robinson.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\n",
      "I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\n",
      "assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\n",
      "women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\n",
      "answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet\n",
      "beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as\n",
      "if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\n",
      "Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\n",
      "is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\n",
      "ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\n",
      "a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\n",
      "sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said\n",
      "Jane.--\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\n",
      "could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at\n",
      "being spoke to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless\n",
      "among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\n",
      "agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\n",
      "agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;\n",
      "every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had\n",
      "heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\n",
      "the ball in a hack chaise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\n",
      "wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\n",
      "if I were you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\n",
      "often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\n",
      "very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,\n",
      "should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\n",
      "to be proud.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\n",
      "_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\n",
      "reflections, \"is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have\n",
      "ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human\n",
      "nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\n",
      "who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\n",
      "quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\n",
      "things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be\n",
      "proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\n",
      "ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas who came with his\n",
      "sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\n",
      "foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle\n",
      "directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\n",
      "would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\n",
      "was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the\n",
      "good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\n",
      "found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a\n",
      "wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the\n",
      "two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\n",
      "pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\n",
      "every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\n",
      "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\n",
      "all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was\n",
      "generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to\n",
      "_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\n",
      "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\n",
      "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\n",
      "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\n",
      "united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\n",
      "uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\n",
      "suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss\n",
      "Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\n",
      "on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\n",
      "so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\n",
      "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\n",
      "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\n",
      "dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\n",
      "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n",
      "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n",
      "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\n",
      "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_\n",
      "affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\n",
      "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\n",
      "perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\n",
      "discover it too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\n",
      "it, he must find it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\n",
      "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\n",
      "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\n",
      "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\n",
      "therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\n",
      "attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\n",
      "in love as much as she chuses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\n",
      "question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\n",
      "to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\n",
      "these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she\n",
      "cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\n",
      "reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\n",
      "dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\n",
      "and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\n",
      "enough to make her understand his character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\n",
      "only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\n",
      "remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\n",
      "evenings may do a great deal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\n",
      "like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\n",
      "leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\n",
      "she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\n",
      "chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a\n",
      "twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\n",
      "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\n",
      "ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n",
      "least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\n",
      "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\n",
      "possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\n",
      "life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\n",
      "sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\n",
      "was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\n",
      "interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\n",
      "allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\n",
      "ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\n",
      "sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\n",
      "hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\n",
      "uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\n",
      "this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\n",
      "detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\n",
      "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\n",
      "pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\n",
      "of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\n",
      "this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made\n",
      "himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough\n",
      "to dance with.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\n",
      "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\n",
      "drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\n",
      "assembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my\n",
      "conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\n",
      "what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\n",
      "being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\n",
      "any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\n",
      "a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\n",
      "turned to him and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\n",
      "just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\n",
      "Meryton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady\n",
      "energetic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are severe on us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going\n",
      "to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\n",
      "to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken\n",
      "a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would\n",
      "really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\n",
      "hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\n",
      "she added, \"Very well; if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\n",
      "at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of\n",
      "course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I\n",
      "shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\n",
      "or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\n",
      "would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\n",
      "sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\n",
      "the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\n",
      "impatient for display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\n",
      "application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\n",
      "manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\n",
      "had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\n",
      "much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\n",
      "end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n",
      "Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\n",
      "some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing\n",
      "at one end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n",
      "passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\n",
      "much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\n",
      "was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There\n",
      "is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first\n",
      "refinements of polished societies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\n",
      "amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can\n",
      "dance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully;\" he\n",
      "continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--\"and I doubt\n",
      "not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\n",
      "you often dance at St. James's?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of\n",
      "superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\n",
      "London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to\n",
      "make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\n",
      "struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\n",
      "her,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow\n",
      "me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You\n",
      "cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.\"\n",
      "And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\n",
      "extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\n",
      "drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you\n",
      "not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her\n",
      "hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all\n",
      "shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\n",
      "the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\n",
      "amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\n",
      "for one half hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\n",
      "cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\n",
      "partner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\n",
      "injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\n",
      "complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should imagine not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\n",
      "in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\n",
      "I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the\n",
      "nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would\n",
      "I give to hear your strictures on them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\n",
      "agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\n",
      "which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\n",
      "would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all astonishment.\n",
      "How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you\n",
      "joy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's\n",
      "imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\n",
      "to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\n",
      "absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\n",
      "of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\n",
      "entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her\n",
      "that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\n",

      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\n",
      "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in\n",
      "default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\n",
      "the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\n",
      "had left her four thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\n",
      "father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\n",
      "London in a respectable line of trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\n",
      "convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\n",
      "thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\n",
      "to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing\n",
      "better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\n",
      "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\n",
      "the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\n",
      "from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\n",
      "news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\n",
      "neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the\n",
      "head quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\n",
      "intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\n",
      "officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\n",
      "and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\n",
      "visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\n",
      "unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n",
      "Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\n",
      "mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\n",
      "an ensign.\n",
      "\n",
      "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\n",
      "Bennet coolly observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\n",
      "of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\n",
      "I am now convinced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\n",
      "indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\n",
      "her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\n",
      "next morning to London.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should be so\n",
      "ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\n",
      "of any body's children, it should not be of my own however.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\n",
      "had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\n",
      "so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\n",
      "foolish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\n",
      "their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will\n",
      "not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\n",
      "liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;\n",
      "and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should\n",
      "want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel\n",
      "Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his\n",
      "regimentals.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mama,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\n",

      "came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\n",
      "note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\n",
      "for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\n",
      "eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,\n",
      "Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;\n",
      "and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\n",

      "will be answered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\n",
      "were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\n",
      "mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\n",
      "day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\n",
      "rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\n",
      "delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n",
      "Jane certainly could not come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet, more than\n",
      "once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\n",
      "morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\n",
      "contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\n",
      "brought the following note for Elizabeth:\n",

      "     \"My dearest Lizzy,\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Yours, &c.\"\n",

      "Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\n",

      "thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\n",
      "horses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\n",
      "when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\n",
      "impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\n",
      "exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\n",
      "Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set\n",
      "off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\n",
      "see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\n",
      "of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\n",
      "field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\n",
      "over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within\n",
      "view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\n",
      "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\n",
      "assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\n",
      "surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,\n",
      "in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.\n",
      "Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her\n",
      "in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;\n",
      "and in their brother's manners there was something better than\n",
      "politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very\n",
      "little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between\n",
      "admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,\n",
      "and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The\n",
      "latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\n",
      "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well\n",
      "enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\n",
      "immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n",
      "alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\n",
      "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n",
      "however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,\n",
      "could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\n",
      "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\n",
      "began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\n",
      "solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\n",
      "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\n",
      "violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n",
      "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n",
      "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n",
      "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\n",
      "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\n",
      "nothing to do elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very\n",
      "unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\n",
      "wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\n",
      "in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n",
      "of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\n",
      "present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\n",
      "dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\n",
      "back a supply of clothes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six\n",
      "Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then\n",
      "poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\n",
      "much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\n",
      "favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\n",
      "this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\n",
      "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n",
      "being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n",
      "indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored\n",
      "Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\n",
      "regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\n",
      "attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\n",
      "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n",
      "others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\n",
      "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\n",
      "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\n",
      "eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish\n",
      "to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n",
      "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\n",
      "pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\n",
      "she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\n",
      "thought the same, and added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n",
      "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\n",
      "looked almost wild.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n",
      "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n",
      "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\n",
      "in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\n",
      "hide it, not doing its office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\n",
      "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\n",
      "well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat\n",
      "quite escaped my notice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\n",
      "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\n",
      "an exhibition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\n",
      "above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\n",
      "it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,\n",
      "a most country town indifference to decorum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\n",
      "Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n",
      "\"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\n",
      "eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"--A\n",
      "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet\n",
      "girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\n",
      "a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\n",
      "chance of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in\n",
      "Meryton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\n",
      "would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\n",
      "consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\n",
      "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\n",
      "their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\n",
      "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\n",
      "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\n",
      "when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\n",
      "down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\n",
      "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\n",
      "them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\n",
      "excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\n",
      "below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\n",
      "reader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\n",
      "_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\n",
      "I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\n",
      "where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\n",
      "others; all that his library afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\n",
      "credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\n",
      "than I ever look into.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\n",
      "in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\n",
      "so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\n",
      "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\n",
      "generations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\n",
      "books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\n",
      "these.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\n",
      "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\n",
      "half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\n",
      "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\n",
      "finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\n",
      "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\n",
      "attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\n",
      "the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\n",
      "sister, to observe the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\n",
      "she be as tall as I am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\n",
      "rather taller.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\n",
      "so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely\n",
      "accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is\n",
      "exquisite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\n",
      "to be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net\n",
      "purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I\n",
      "never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\n",
      "informed that she was very accomplished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\n",
      "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\n",
      "otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very\n",
      "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\n",
      "cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my\n",
      "acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\n",
      "idea of an accomplished woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\n",
      "esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\n",
      "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\n",
      "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all\n",
      "this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\n",
      "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\n",
      "will be but half deserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet\n",
      "add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\n",
      "extensive reading.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all\n",
      "this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\n",
      "application, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\n",
      "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\n",
      "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\n",
      "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\n",
      "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is\n",
      "one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\n",
      "sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\n",
      "succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n",
      "\"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\n",
      "to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\n",
      "despicable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\n",
      "continue the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\n",
      "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for\n",
      "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\n",
      "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\n",
      "eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so\n",
      "unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\n",
      "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\n",
      "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\n",
      "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\n",
      "however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to\n",
      "his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\n",
      "possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER IX.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\n",
      "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\n",
      "enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\n",
      "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\n",
      "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\n",
      "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n",
      "own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\n",
      "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\n",
      "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\n",
      "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\n",
      "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\n",
      "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\n",
      "would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried\n",
      "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\n",
      "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\n",
      "Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\n",
      "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\n",
      "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I have, Sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\n",
      "moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\n",
      "a little longer on your kindness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\n",
      "sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n",
      "\"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\n",
      "remains with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\n",
      "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\n",
      "vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\n",
      "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\n",
      "temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\n",
      "_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\n",
      "over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\n",
      "equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I\n",
      "hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\n",
      "should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\n",
      "minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\n",
      "through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\n",
      "intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\n",
      "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\n",
      "studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\n",
      "least that advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but few subjects for\n",
      "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined\n",
      "and unvarying society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\n",
      "observed in them for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\n",
      "country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\n",
      "going on in the country as in town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\n",
      "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\n",
      "victory over him, continued her triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for\n",
      "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\n",
      "pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and\n",
      "when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\n",
      "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\n",
      "gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\n",
      "at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\n",
      "mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not\n",
      "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\n",
      "you must acknowledge to be true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\n",
      "many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\n",
      "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\n",
      "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\n",
      "saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\n",
      "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\n",
      "William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\n",
      "genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every\n",
      "body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy\n",
      "themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the\n",
      "matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For\n",
      "my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\n",
      "work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to\n",
      "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I\n",
      "assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\n",
      "Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She seems a very pleasant young woman,\" said Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\n",
      "has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\n",
      "of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body\n",
      "better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own\n",
      "partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my\n",
      "brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my\n",
      "sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\n",
      "But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\n",
      "wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\n",
      "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\n",
      "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is\n",
      "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\n",
      "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\n",
      "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\n",
      "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\n",
      "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\n",
      "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\n",
      "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\n",
      "indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\n",
      "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\n",
      "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\n",
      "each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\n",
      "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\n",
      "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\n",
      "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\n",
      "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\n",
      "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\n",
      "attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own\n",
      "easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\n",
      "equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\n",
      "abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\n",
      "shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\n",
      "sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\n",
      "your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of\n",
      "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\n",
      "wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\n",
      "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\n",
      "added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\n",
      "Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\n",
      "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\n",
      "remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\n",
      "could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\n",
      "all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.\n",

      "CHAPTER X.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\n",
      "Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\n",
      "continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\n",
      "their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\n",
      "the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\n",
      "messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\n",
      "attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\n",
      "commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\n",
      "of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\n",
      "with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\n",
      "exactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the\n",
      "year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\n",
      "pens remarkably well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\n",
      "and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\n",
      "little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\n",
      "Grantley's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At\n",
      "present I have not room to do them justice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\n",
      "always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\n",
      "to determine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with\n",
      "ease, cannot write ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\n",
      "brother--\"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\n",
      "words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\n",
      "imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\n",
      "means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\n",
      "humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\n",
      "indirect boast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in\n",
      "writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\n",
      "thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think\n",
      "at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with\n",
      "quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\n",
      "attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\n",
      "you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\n",
      "panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\n",
      "laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\n",
      "undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\n",
      "foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\n",
      "believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\n",
      "moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\n",
      "precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\n",
      "would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\n",
      "dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\n",
      "mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay\n",
      "till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\n",
      "go--and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\n",
      "not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much\n",
      "more than he did himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\n",
      "friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\n",
      "afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\n",
      "intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\n",
      "circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\n",
      "could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\n",
      "as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for\n",
      "himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\n",
      "which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand\n",
      "according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that\n",
      "the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the\n",
      "delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\n",
      "argument in favour of its propriety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\n",
      "with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\n",
      "either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\n",
      "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\n",
      "one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\n",
      "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\n",
      "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n",
      "circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\n",
      "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\n",
      "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\n",
      "very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\n",
      "with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\n",
      "with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\n",
      "appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\n",
      "between the parties?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\n",
      "forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\n",
      "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\n",
      "you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\n",
      "myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\n",
      "know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\n",
      "particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening\n",
      "when he has nothing to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\n",
      "rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\n",
      "resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\n",
      "brother for talking such nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.--\"You dislike an\n",
      "argument, and want to silence this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\n",
      "Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\n",
      "thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\n",
      "Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\n",
      "for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\n",
      "the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\n",
      "the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\n",
      "seated herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books\n",
      "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\n",
      "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n",
      "admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\n",
      "he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however\n",
      "at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about\n",
      "her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than\n",
      "in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\n",
      "him too little to care for his approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\n",
      "lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\n",
      "Elizabeth, said to her--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\n",
      "opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\n",
      "surprise at her silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before; but I could not immediately\n",
      "determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\n",
      "that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\n",
      "delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\n",
      "their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell\n",
      "you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\n",
      "you dare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\n",
      "gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\n",
      "manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had\n",
      "never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\n",
      "believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\n",
      "should be in some danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\n",
      "anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some\n",
      "assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\n",
      "their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\n",
      "next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\n",
      "desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\n",
      "and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\n",
      "the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\n",
      "check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\n",
      "which your lady possesses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\n",
      "placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle\n",
      "the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different\n",
      "lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it\n",
      "taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\n",
      "colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be\n",
      "copied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\n",
      "confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n",

      "\n",
      "She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\n",

      "When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,\n",
      "and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\n",
      "drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\n",
      "professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\n",
      "as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\n",
      "Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\n",
      "entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\n",
      "at their acquaintance with spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.\n",
      "Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\n",
      "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\n",
      "himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\n",
      "also made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\n",
      "and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\n",
      "attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\n",
      "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to\n",
      "the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the\n",
      "door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.\n",
      "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\n",
      "card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\n",
      "Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\n",
      "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\n",
      "silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.\n",
      "Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\n",
      "sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\n",
      "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\n",
      "rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\n",
      "Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\n",
      "Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\n",
      "perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\n",
      "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\n",
      "question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\n",
      "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\n",
      "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\n",
      "is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\n",
      "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a\n",
      "book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\n",
      "an excellent library.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\n",
      "cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing\n",
      "her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\n",
      "towards him and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\n",
      "Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\n",
      "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\n",
      "some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\n",
      "pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chuses,\n",
      "before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and\n",
      "as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my\n",
      "cards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\n",
      "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\n",
      "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\n",
      "more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\n",
      "day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\n",
      "near so much like a ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about\n",
      "the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at\n",
      "whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation\n",
      "of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to\n",
      "Elizabeth, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\n",
      "turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting\n",
      "so long in one attitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\n",
      "succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\n",
      "up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\n",
      "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\n",
      "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,\n",
      "that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and\n",
      "down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them\n",
      "would interfere. \"What could he mean? she was dying to know what could\n",
      "be his meaning\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\n",
      "him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\n",
      "on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing\n",
      "about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any\n",
      "thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two\n",
      "motives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\n",
      "as she allowed him to speak. \"You either chuse this method of passing\n",
      "the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret\n",
      "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\n",
      "appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be\n",
      "completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better\n",
      "as I sit by the fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard any thing so\n",
      "abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\n",
      "can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at\n",
      "him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\n",
      "yet taught me _that_. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\n",
      "no--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\n",
      "ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\n",
      "Darcy may hug himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\n",
      "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\n",
      "be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\n",
      "laugh.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me credit for more than can be. The\n",
      "wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,\n",
      "may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\n",
      "joke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I am\n",
      "not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\n",
      "and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I\n",
      "laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what\n",
      "you are without.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of\n",
      "my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\n",
      "understanding to ridicule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\n",
      "superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\n",
      "Bingley;--\"and pray what is the result?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\n",
      "himself without disguise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No\"--said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\n",
      "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\n",
      "for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the\n",
      "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\n",
      "others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\n",
      "feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\n",
      "would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost\n",
      "for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\"--cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\n",
      "_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I\n",
      "really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\n",
      "evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was\n",

      "her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\n",
      "would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\n",
      "them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\n",
      "least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\n",
      "before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\n",
      "and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\n",
      "well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\n",
      "resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\n",
      "contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\n",
      "she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\n",
      "length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\n",
      "that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\n",
      "said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\n",
      "Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\n",
      "then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\n",
      "of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\n",
      "soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\n",
      "safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\n",
      "she felt herself to be right.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\n",
      "Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\n",
      "Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.\n",
      "He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\n",
      "should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\n",
      "influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\n",
      "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\n",
      "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\n",
      "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at\n",
      "one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\n",
      "conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\n",

      "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\n",

      "after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\n",
      "see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\n",

      "They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\n",
      "wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\n",

      "father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\n",
      "glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\n",

      "\"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \"He seems to be a most\n",
      "conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will\n",
      "prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\n",
      "indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he\n",
      "is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\n",
      "discourage him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean\n",
      "to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\n",
      "credit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady\n",
      "Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\n",
      "his parishioners whenever it were required.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make him\n",
      "out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\n",
      "mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\n",
      "would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\n",
      "reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\n",
      "letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"his letter does not seem\n",
      "defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\n",
      "think it is well expressed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\n",
      "degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\n",
      "come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\n",
      "received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\n",
      "their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,\n",
      "and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which\n",
      "astonished her husband and daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\n",
      "politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\n",
      "ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\n",
      "of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\n",
      "heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and\n",
      "stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\n",
      "before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\n",
      "daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\n",
      "instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\n",
      "not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.\n",
      "This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\n",
      "prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\n",
      "oddly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\n",
      "must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\n",
      "I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\n",
      "will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and\n",
      "could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\n",
      "forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\n",
      "prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps\n",
      "when we are better acquainted----\"\n",

      "He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\n",
      "other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The\n",
      "hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\n",
      "and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\n",
      "heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\n",
      "own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\n",
      "he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its\n",
      "cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\n",
      "him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\n",
      "cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\n",
      "pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\n",

      "During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\n",
      "were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\n",
      "guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\n",
      "shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\n",
      "Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\n",
      "comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\n",
      "better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\n",
      "to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\n",
      "he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\n",
      "person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\n",
      "experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\n",
      "approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of\n",
      "preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\n",
      "and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\n",
      "quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\n",
      "people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.\n",
      "She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\n",
      "made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\n",
      "two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\n",
      "marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\n",
      "once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\n",
      "approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\n",
      "to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I\n",
      "dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\n",
      "in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane\n",
      "from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\n",
      "extensive property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\n",
      "many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\n",
      "that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the\n",
      "handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\n",
      "the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\n",
      "constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\n",
      "accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am\n",
      "informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\n",
      "resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\n",
      "to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\n",
      "court.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\n",
      "and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\n",
      "the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\n",
      "with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\n",
      "offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\n",
      "ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\n",
      "charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\n",
      "elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\n",
      "her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\n",
      "it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\n",
      "pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\n",
      "that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\n",
      "whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\n",
      "moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\n",
      "sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\n",
      "compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\n",
      "give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\n",
      "as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\n",
      "maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\n",
      "and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in\n",
      "his pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to\n",
      "take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad\n",
      "to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,\n",
      "and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced\n",
      "it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging\n",
      "pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and\n",
      "Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation\n",
      "he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and\n",
      "before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\n",
      "interrupted him with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,\n",
      "and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so\n",
      "herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\n",
      "about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\n",
      "Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\n",
      "of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\n",
      "me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\n",
      "them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\n",
      "backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\n",
      "very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\n",
      "interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\n",
      "resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\n",
      "been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\n",
      "his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\n",
      "miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\n",
      "had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\n",
      "acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had\n",
      "given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good\n",
      "deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\n",
      "retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\n",
      "prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\n",
      "Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\n",
      "felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\n",
      "mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\n",
      "clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\n",
      "pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to\n",
      "marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\n",
      "a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found\n",
      "them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\n",
      "This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\n",
      "estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\n",
      "suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\n",
      "part.\n",
      "\n",
      "His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face\n",
      "confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\n",
      "was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\n",
      "choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\n",
      "of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\n",
      "conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\n",
      "to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\n",
      "Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\n",
      "encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--\"As to\n",
      "her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could\n",
      "not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\n",
      "_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\n",
      "to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\n",
      "done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\n",
      "next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\n",
      "two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\n",
      "the day before, was now high in her good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\n",
      "except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\n",
      "at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\n",

      "him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\n",
      "one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\n",
      "Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\n",
      "doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\n",
      "always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\n",
      "Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\n",
      "house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\n",
      "was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\n",
      "walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\n",
      "than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\n",
      "go.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\n",
      "cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\n",
      "the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\n",
      "were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,\n",
      "and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin\n",
      "in a shop window, could recal them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\n",
      "they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\n",
      "with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\n",
      "Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\n",
      "and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,\n",
      "all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\n",
      "possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\n",
      "wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\n",
      "the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\n",
      "spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\n",
      "introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\n",
      "before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\n",
      "their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\n",
      "only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\n",
      "greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\n",
      "countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\n",
      "was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\n",
      "readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\n",
      "whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\n",
      "when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\n",
      "seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,\n",
      "the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\n",
      "civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\n",
      "principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\n",
      "purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\n",
      "was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\n",
      "were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\n",
      "happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\n",
      "was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\n",
      "one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\n",
      "touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\n",
      "What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was\n",
      "impossible not to long to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\n",
      "passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\n",
      "Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\n",
      "pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\n",
      "Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\n",
      "invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from\n",
      "their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\n",
      "expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\n",
      "carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\n",
      "she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had\n",
      "told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield\n",
      "because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\n",
      "towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with\n",
      "her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\n",
      "apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\n",
      "her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\n",
      "justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\n",
      "her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\n",
      "breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\n",
      "by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\n",
      "could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\n",
      "brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\n",
      "commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\n",
      "she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham\n",
      "appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\n",
      "but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\n",
      "officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\n",
      "disagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\n",
      "next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\n",
      "would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips\n",
      "protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\n",

      "delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\n",
      "Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\n",
      "with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\n",
      "between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\n",
      "both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\n",
      "behaviour than her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\n",
      "Philips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady\n",
      "Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\n",
      "she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\n",
      "pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\n",
      "utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed\n",
      "to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\n",
      "aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\n",
      "a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\n",
      "conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\n",
      "girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\n",
      "that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\n",
      "the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\n",
      "Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\n",
      "struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\n",
      "might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\n",
      "at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\n",
      "gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\n",
      "was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\n",
      "description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\n",
      "that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\n",
      "the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\n",
      "with the housekeeper's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\n",
      "with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\n",
      "improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\n",
      "gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\n",
      "listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\n",
      "heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\n",
      "soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\n",
      "and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\n",
      "their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the\n",
      "interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The\n",
      "gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\n",
      "of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\n",
      "officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\n",
      "gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\n",
      "walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\n",
      "breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\n",
      "turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\n",
      "himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\n",
      "conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\n",
      "probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\n",
      "dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the\n",
      "skill of the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the\n",
      "officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the\n",
      "young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a\n",
      "kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most\n",
      "abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her\n",
      "in return, by sitting down to whist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know little of the game, at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad\n",
      "to improve myself, for in my situation of life----\" Mrs. Philips was\n",
      "very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\n",
      "received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\n",
      "seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\n",
      "determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\n",
      "she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\n",
      "and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in\n",
      "particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was\n",
      "therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to\n",
      "hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to\n",
      "be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\n",
      "even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly\n",
      "relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\n",
      "Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\n",
      "an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\n",
      "drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\n",
      "understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Wickham;--\"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\n",
      "thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\n",
      "giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\n",
      "connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\n",
      "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\n",
      "yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,--\"I have spent\n",
      "four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\n",
      "disagreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\n",
      "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\n",
      "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\n",
      "be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\n",
      "astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\n",
      "anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\n",
      "Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\n",
      "him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\n",
      "interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\n",
      "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\n",
      "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\n",
      "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\n",
      "ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\n",
      "likely to be in this country much longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\n",
      "was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\n",
      "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\n",
      "wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\n",
      "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\n",
      "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\n",
      "very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\n",
      "His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\n",
      "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\n",
      "in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\n",
      "thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\n",
      "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every\n",
      "thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory\n",
      "of his father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\n",
      "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\n",
      "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\n",
      "had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\n",
      "very intelligible gallantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n",
      "\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a\n",
      "most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\n",
      "farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\n",
      "attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\n",
      "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\n",
      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\n",
      "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\n",
      "was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\n",
      "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\n",
      "were speaking of just now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\n",
      "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
      "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\n",
      "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n",
      "elsewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?--How could\n",
      "his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\n",
      "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\n",
      "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\n",
      "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\n",
      "to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.\n",
      "Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\n",
      "was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\n",
      "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\n",
      "any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\n",
      "may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\n",
      "freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\n",
      "different sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\n",
      "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\n",
      "ever as he expressed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?--what\n",
      "can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\n",
      "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\n",
      "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\n",
      "attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not\n",
      "a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\n",
      "preference which was often given me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\n",
      "him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\n",
      "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\n",
      "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember\n",
      "his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\n",
      "resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must\n",
      "be dreadful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"_I_ can\n",
      "hardly be just to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\n",
      "treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\n",
      "father!\"--She could have added, \"A young man too, like _you_, whose very\n",
      "countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented\n",
      "herself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\n",
      "childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\n",
      "manner!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\n",
      "part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\n",
      "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\n",
      "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\n",
      "appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\n",
      "to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\n",
      "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n",
      "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\n",
      "be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,\n",
      "and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\n",
      "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\n",
      "be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!--I wonder that the very\n",
      "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\n",
      "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\n",
      "dishonesty I must call it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It _is_ wonderful,\"--replied Wickham,--\"for almost all his actions may\n",
      "be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has\n",
      "connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\n",
      "of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\n",
      "impulses even than pride.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his\n",
      "money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\n",
      "the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what\n",
      "his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\n",
      "degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\n",
      "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\n",
      "which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\n",
      "guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\n",
      "most attentive and best of brothers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.--\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain\n",
      "to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,\n",
      "very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\n",
      "extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\n",
      "amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about\n",
      "fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her\n",
      "father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,\n",
      "and superintends her education.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\n",
      "help reverting once more to the first, and saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\n",
      "who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\n",
      "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you\n",
      "know Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\n",
      "Darcy is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not\n",
      "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\n",
      "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\n",
      "very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\n",
      "never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,\n",
      "sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing\n",
      "something for fortune and figure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\n",
      "the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\n",
      "Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were\n",
      "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\n",
      "but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\n",
      "her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\n",
      "that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\n",
      "make herself uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\n",
      "card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\n",
      "am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\n",
      "are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\n",
      "Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\n",
      "little matters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\n",
      "a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\n",
      "were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a\n",
      "living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\n",
      "notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\n",
      "were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\n",
      "connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\n",
      "yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\n",
      "believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\n",
      "Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\n",
      "affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\n",
      "self-destined to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\n",
      "daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\n",
      "I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\n",
      "patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\n",
      "not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\n",
      "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\n",
      "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\n",
      "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\n",
      "her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\n",
      "chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of\n",
      "the first class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\n",
      "they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\n",

      "Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\n",

      "did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\n",
      "amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\n",
      "scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\n",

      "good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\n",
      "gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first\n",

      "being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\n",
      "quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\n",
      "The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\n",
      "civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\n",
      "compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\n",
      "gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\n",
      "her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\n",
      "was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to\n",
      "take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\n",

      "If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\n",

      "vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\n",
      "doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\n",
      "meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\n",
      "might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\n",
      "usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\n",
      "that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\n",
      "might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\n",
      "dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\n",
      "pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this\n",
      "was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\n",

      "who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\n",
      "the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\n",

      "This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\n",
      "Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\n",
      "Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\n",
      "of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\n",
      "disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\n",
      "the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to\n",
      "make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\n",
      "Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\n",
      "turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\n",
      "surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\n",
      "provoked her.\n",

      "spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\n",
      "not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\n",
      "the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\n",
      "notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;\n",
      "they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\n",
      "apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\n",
      "aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\n",
      "partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\n",
      "him was ecstacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\n",
      "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\n",
      "were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\n",
      "her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\n",
      "her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\n",
      "knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\n",
      "immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\n",
      "mind; Charlotte tried to console her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To\n",
      "find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me\n",
      "such an evil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\n",
      "hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a\n",
      "simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\n",
      "in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\n",
      "answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\n",
      "she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\n",
      "reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\n",
      "They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\n",
      "imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\n",
      "first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\n",
      "be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\n",
      "some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.\n",
      "After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about\n",
      "the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\n",
      "the room, or the number of couples.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I\n",
      "may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\n",
      "ones.--But _now_ we may be silent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\n",
      "entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\n",
      "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\n",
      "trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\n",
      "imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\n",
      "similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,\n",
      "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\n",
      "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\n",
      "posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\n",
      "said he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_\n",
      "think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\n",
      "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\n",
      "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\n",
      "the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\n",
      "been forming a new acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\n",
      "features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\n",
      "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\n",
      "constrained manner said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\n",
      "_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\n",
      "is less certain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\n",
      "with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\n",
      "his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\n",
      "that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\n",
      "through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\n",
      "Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\n",
      "dancing and his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very\n",
      "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\n",
      "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\n",
      "disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\n",
      "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\n",
      "at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will\n",
      "then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\n",
      "Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\n",
      "converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\n",
      "William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\n",
      "eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\n",
      "Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\n",
      "he turned to his partner, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\n",
      "interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\n",
      "themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\n",
      "success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\n",
      "feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\n",
      "no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\n",
      "something else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\n",
      "with a look of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\n",
      "thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\n",
      "by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\n",
      "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\n",
      "created_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"I hope not.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\n",
      "to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is your success?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary\n",
      "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\n",
      "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\n",

      "\n",

      "opportunity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\n",
      "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\n",
      "silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for\n",
      "in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\n",
      "which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\n",
      "another.\n",

      "thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,\n",
      "among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the\n",
      "late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,\n",
      "not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.\n",

      "has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has\n",
      "treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\n",
      "particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to\n",
      "blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that\n",
      "though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his\n",
      "invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had\n",
      "taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a\n",
      "most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\n",
      "I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;\n",
      "but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\n",
      "Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\n",
      "than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\n",
      "assure you, he informed me himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
      "\"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.--\"You are much mistaken if\n",
      "you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\n",
      "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\n",
      "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\n",
      "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n",
      "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\n",
      "evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment\n",
      "solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing\n",
      "else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\n",
      "sister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\n",
      "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\n",
      "you may be sure of my pardon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
      "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\n",
      "history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\n",
      "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\n",
      "the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n",
      "received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his\n",
      "sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\n",
      "afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's\n",
      "regard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\n",
      "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\n",
      "him _conditionally_ only.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\n",
      "\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\n",
      "Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but\n",
      "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\n",
      "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\n",
      "both gentlemen as I did before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\n",
      "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\n",
      "delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\n",
      "Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\n",
      "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\n",
      "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\n",
      "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and\n",
      "told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to\n",
      "make a most important discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\n",
      "in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\n",
      "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\n",
      "this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother\n",
      "Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\n",
      "have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\n",
      "Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made\n",
      "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\n",
      "and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\n",
      "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\n",
      "assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\n",
      "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\n",
      "an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\n",
      "was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\n",
      "side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n",
      "consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her\n",
      "with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\n",
      "ceased speaking, replied thus,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\n",
      "excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\n",
      "understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\n",
      "between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\n",
      "which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\n",
      "the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\n",
      "in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\n",
      "same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates\n",
      "of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look\n",
      "on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your\n",
      "advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\n",
      "in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and\n",
      "habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\n",
      "yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\n",
      "reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\n",
      "being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\n",
      "a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\n",
      "hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\"\n",
      "\"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"--It vexed her to see him\n",
      "expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\n",
      "wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\n",
      "with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\n",
      "discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\n",
      "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\n",
      "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\n",
      "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\n",
      "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\n",
      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\n",
      "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\n",
      "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\n",
      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\n",
      "made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\n",
      "that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\n",
      "could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\n",
      "endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\n",
      "she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\n",
      "venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\n",
      "supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\n",
      "placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\n",
      "that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\n",
      "openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\n",
      "soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\n",
      "the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\n",
      "but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\n",
      "and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\n",
      "Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\n",
      "she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n",
      "daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\n",
      "other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\n",
      "able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\n",
      "she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\n",
      "necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\n",
      "such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\n",
      "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\n",
      "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\n",
      "chance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\n",
      "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\n",
      "whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",
      "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\n",
      "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\n",
      "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you\n",
      "to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\n",
      "so doing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother\n",
      "would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed\n",
      "and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",
      "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\n",
      "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\n",
      "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\n",
      "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\n",
      "steady gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\n",
      "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\n",
      "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\n",
      "Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\n",
      "tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\n",
      "had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
      "entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\n",
      "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n",
      "Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\n",
      "watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\n",
      "which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\n",
      "amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\n",
      "prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\n",
      "began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\n",
      "her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.\n",
      "She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\n",
      "talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\n",
      "signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however\n",
      "impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
      "and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\n",
      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
      "Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to\n",
      "assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\n",
      "music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make\n",
      "such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every\n",
      "body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot\n",
      "acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should\n",
      "omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected\n",
      "with the family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\n",
      "which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many\n",
      "stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet\n",
      "himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having\n",
      "spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that\n",
      "he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\n",
      "she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\n",
      "the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by\n",
      "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\n",
      "could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\n",
      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
      "somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\n",
      "He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\n",
      "that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\n",
      "her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\n",
      "the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\n",
      "her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\n",
      "good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\n",
      "manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of\n",
      "an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\n",
      "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\n",
      "long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\n",
      "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\n",
      "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\n",
      "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\n",
      "rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\n",
      "silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\n",
      "much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\n",
      "how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\n",
      "civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\n",
      "addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\n",
      "he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\n",
      "without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\n",
      "pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\n",
      "waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\n",
      "go the next day for a short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\n",
      "delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\n",
      "settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\n",
      "see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four\n",
      "months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\n",
      "with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\n",
      "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\n",
      "man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\n",
      "was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n",

      "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\n",
      "declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\n",
      "his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\n",
      "no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\n",
      "moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\n",
      "observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\n",
      "after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\n",
      "when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\n",

      "\n",
      "Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet instantly answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am\n",
      "sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\" And\n",
      "gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\n",
      "called out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse\n",
      "me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am\n",
      "going away myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are.\"--And\n",
      "upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\n",
      "to escape, she added, \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\n",
      "Mr. Collins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\n",
      "consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\n",
      "over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\n",
      "to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\n",
      "between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\n",
      "soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\n",
      "doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\n",
      "would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\n",
      "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\n",
      "mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\n",
      "of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\n",
      "dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\n",
      "soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\n",
      "future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\n",
      "subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\n",
      "marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\n",
      "selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\n",
      "with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\n",
      "use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\n",
      "he continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\n",
      "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\n",
      "of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\n",
      "very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\n",
      "mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\n",
      "of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\n",
      "Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\n",
      "subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\n",
      "Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\n",
      "arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\n",
      "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a\n",
      "gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\n",
      "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n",
      "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n",
      "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\n",
      "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\n",
      "kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n",
      "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any\n",
      "thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be\n",
      "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\n",
      "which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n",
      "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n",
      "were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n",
      "assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n",
      "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n",
      "father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\n",
      "myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\n",
      "the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\n",
      "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\n",
      "for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\n",
      "flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n",
      "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n",
      "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n",
      "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n",
      "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n",
      "in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's\n",
      "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n",
      "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\n",
      "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\n",
      "answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for\n",
      "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n",
      "your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n",
      "hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\n",
      "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n",
      "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\n",
      "third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\n",
      "said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, Sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an\n",
      "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n",
      "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n",
      "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n",
      "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_\n",
      "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n",
      "would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n",
      "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n",
      "situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\n",
      "very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\n",
      "disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\n",
      "seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\n",
      "economy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\n",
      "give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\n",
      "believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n",
      "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n",
      "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n",
      "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\n",
      "considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus\n",
      "spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\n",
      "addressed her,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I\n",
      "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n",
      "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n",
      "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\n",
      "first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\n",
      "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n",
      "female character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\n",
      "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n",
      "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n",
      "may convince you of its being one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n",
      "refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\n",
      "believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\n",
      "is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\n",
      "be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\n",
      "with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n",
      "circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther\n",
      "consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\n",
      "means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\n",
      "portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the\n",
      "effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\n",
      "therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n",
      "shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n",
      "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind\n",
      "of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\n",
      "rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\n",
      "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n",
      "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n",
      "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n",
      "female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\n",
      "truth from her heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\n",
      "gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\n",
      "authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\n",
      "being acceptable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\n",
      "reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he\n",
      "persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\n",
      "encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\n",
      "in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\n",
      "not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\n",
      "successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\n",
      "to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\n",
      "door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\n",
      "entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\n",
      "warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\n",
      "received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\n",
      "proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\n",
      "of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\n",
      "refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\n",
      "from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n",
      "\n",
      "This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been\n",
      "glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\n",
      "him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\n",
      "it, and could not help saying so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\n",
      "brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\n",
      "a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\n",
      "I will _make_ her know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she\n",
      "is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\n",
      "altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\n",
      "naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\n",
      "actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\n",
      "force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\n",
      "temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\n",
      "only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as\n",
      "good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\n",
      "we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\n",
      "You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\n",
      "not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\n",
      "not have _her_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\n",

      "her communication.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\n",
      "be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\n",
      "again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\n",
      "if you _do_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\n",
      "but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\n",
      "affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\n",
      "to _insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\n",
      "First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\n",
      "present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\n",

      "\n",
      "Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\n",
      "coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\n",
      "her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined\n",
      "interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and\n",
      "sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner\n",
      "varied however, her determination never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\n",
      "He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\n",
      "could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\n",
      "way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\n",
      "deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\n",
      "the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\n",
      "her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\n",
      "fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has\n",
      "made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\n",
      "who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the\n",
      "breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\n",
      "the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\n",
      "her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\n",
      "family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\n",
      "\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,\n",
      "nobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\n",
      "as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\n",
      "she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take\n",
      "it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\n",
      "you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\n",
      "to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep\n",
      "you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I\n",
      "told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you\n",
      "again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in\n",
      "talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in\n",
      "talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints\n",
      "can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I\n",
      "suffer!--But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never\n",
      "pitied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\n",
      "attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.\n",
      "She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\n",
      "they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\n",
      "than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\n",
      "let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\n",
      "Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\n",
      "detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\n",
      "herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\n",
      "curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\n",
      "not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\n",
      "conversation.--\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\n",
      "Far be it from me,\" he presently continued in a voice that marked his\n",
      "displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\n",
      "inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man\n",
      "who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I\n",
      "trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\n",
      "positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\n",
      "have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\n",
      "blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\n",
      "You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your\n",
      "family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\n",
      "daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\n",
      "compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\n",
      "My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission\n",
      "from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to\n",
      "error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object\n",
      "has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\n",
      "consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\n",

      "attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\n",
      "As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\n",
      "by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\n",
      "stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\n",
      "her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\n",

      "them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.\n",
      "His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\n",
      "compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\n",
      "occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\n",
      "from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\n",
      "sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's\n",
      "fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as\n",
      "she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\n",
      "Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\n",
      "join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\n",
      "Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\n",
      "even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\n",
      "than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they\n",
      "had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\n",
      "good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\n",
      "on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.\n",
      "You shall hear what she says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\n",
      "of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\n",
      "and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.\n",
      "Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\n",
      "regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\n",
      "dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\n",
      "returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\n",
      "while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\n",
      "unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\n",
      "flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\n",
      "distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\n",
      "saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\n",
      "absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\n",
      "to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\n",
      "cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\n",
      "able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\n",
      "hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\n",
      "forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\n",
      "intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\n",
      "satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\n",
      "Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\n",
      "took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\n",
      "are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\n",
      "Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\n",
      "determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\n",
      "his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\n",
      "already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\n",
      "friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\n",
      "despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\n",
      "the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\n",
      "will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of\n",
      "whom we shall deprive you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\n",
      "winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.\n",
      "But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\n",
      "particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\n",
      "is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\n",
      "scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\n",
      "Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\n",
      "affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\n",
      "something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\n",
      "her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\n",
      "mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\n",
      "country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\n",
      "unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\n",
      "frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\n",
      "relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\n",
      "partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\n",
      "capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\n",
      "favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\n",
      "Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\n",
      "of so many?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\n",
      "finished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\n",
      "that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\n",
      "is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\n",
      "suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\n",
      "put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most willingly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\n",
      "in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\n",
      "town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\n",
      "does not care about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\n",
      "together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\n",
      "not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\n",
      "for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\n",
      "this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\n",
      "more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\n",
      "when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\n",
      "achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\n",
      "dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\n",
      "my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\n",
      "tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n",
      "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\n",
      "Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\n",
      "being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\n",
      "representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\n",
      "foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\n",
      "one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\n",
      "herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\n",
      "will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\n",
      "You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\n",
      "accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\n",
      "elsewhere?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\n",
      "deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\n",
      "more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\n",
      "all means to refuse him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\n",
      "though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\n",
      "not hesitate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\n",
      "your situation with much compassion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\n",
      "required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\n",
      "contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\n",
      "interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\n",
      "wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\n",
      "so totally independent of every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\n",
      "the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\n",
      "Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\n",
      "though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\n",
      "Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\n",
      "family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\n",
      "but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\n",
      "and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\n",
      "to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n",
      "lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\n",
      "that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\n",
      "and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\n",
      "he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\n",
      "two full courses.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the\n",
      "chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\n",
      "Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good\n",
      "humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"\n",
      "Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\n",
      "that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\n",
      "very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\n",
      "had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her\n",
      "from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\n",
      "herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\n",
      "favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\n",
      "sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\n",
      "But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\n",
      "character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\n",
      "morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n",
      "himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n",
      "from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n",
      "conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n",
      "till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost\n",
      "secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n",
      "he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\n",
      "reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived\n",
      "him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly\n",
      "set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared\n",
      "to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every\n",
      "thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they\n",
      "entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was\n",
      "to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be\n",
      "waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his\n",
      "happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must\n",
      "guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\n",
      "continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\n",
      "disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\n",
      "establishment were gained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\n",
      "and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present\n",
      "circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n",
      "they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n",
      "exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more\n",
      "interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\n",
      "opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\n",
      "Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\n",
      "should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short\n",
      "were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\n",
      "of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\n",
      "done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\n",
      "dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\n",
      "gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\n",
      "in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor\n",
      "agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be\n",
      "imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly\n",
      "either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it\n",
      "was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small\n",
      "fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their\n",
      "pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now\n",
      "obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\n",
      "handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\n",
      "circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to\n",
      "Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other\n",
      "person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though\n",
      "her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such\n",
      "disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and\n",
      "therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\n",
      "to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise\n",
      "of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept\n",
      "without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst\n",
      "forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some\n",
      "ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great\n",
      "self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\n",
      "family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\n",
      "for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said\n",
      "how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his\n",
      "other engagements might allow him to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\n",
      "gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\n",
      "may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\n",
      "possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\n",
      "so speedy a return, immediately said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\n",
      "good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of\n",
      "offending your patroness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\n",
      "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n",
      "material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her\n",
      "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n",
      "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n",
      "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n",
      "affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n",
      "from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of\n",
      "your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\n",
      "though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\n",
      "now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n",
      "my cousin Elizabeth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n",
      "surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\n",
      "to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\n",
      "her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
      "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a\n",
      "solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\n",
      "means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\n",
      "improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very\n",
      "agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\n",
      "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n",
      "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\n",
      "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\n",
      "that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\n",
      "possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\n",
      "astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\n",
      "bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\n",
      "story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\n",
      "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\n",
      "regained her composure, and calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\n",
      "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\n",
      "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\n",
      "for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\n",
      "of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\n",
      "her all imaginable happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,--\"you must be\n",
      "surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to\n",
      "marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you\n",
      "will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I\n",
      "never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\n",
      "character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n",
      "chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\n",
      "entering the marriage state.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"--and after an awkward pause,\n",
      "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\n",
      "longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\n",
      "was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n",
      "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\n",
      "of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\n",
      "now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\n",
      "was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\n",
      "possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\n",
      "better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,\n",
      "was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\n",
      "herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\n",
      "that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\n",
      "she had chosen.\n",

      "Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\n",
      "she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,\n",
      "when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\n",
      "announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\n",
      "and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\n",
      "houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\n",
      "but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\n",

      "Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\n",
      "without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\n",
      "him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\n",
      "truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\n",
      "most forbearing courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\n",
      "a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\n",
      "mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\n",
      "endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\n",
      "by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\n",
      "was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\n",
      "happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\n",
      "of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\n",

      "Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\n",
      "Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\n",
      "found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\n",
      "the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\n",
      "had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\n",
      "together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\n",
      "inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\n",
      "Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\n",
      "she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\n",
      "points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\n",
      "console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her\n",
      "resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\n",
      "scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\n",

      "could at all forgive their daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\n",
      "as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\n",
      "it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\n",
      "been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\n",
      "more foolish than his daughter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\n",
      "less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\n",
      "nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\n",
      "Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\n",
      "clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\n",
      "to spread at Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\n",
      "called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\n",
      "though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\n",
      "enough to drive happiness away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\n",
      "mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\n",
      "real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\n",
      "disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\n",
      "sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\n",
      "never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\n",
      "Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\n",
      "the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\n",
      "letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\n",
      "father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\n",
      "twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\n",
      "his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\n",
      "rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\n",
      "of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\n",
      "merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\n",
      "to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\n",
      "he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\n",
      "he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\n",
      "place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\n",
      "argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\n",
      "the happiest of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\n",
      "pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to\n",
      "complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come\n",
      "to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\n",
      "and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house\n",
      "while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\n",
      "most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\n",
      "gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\n",
      "absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\n",
      "day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\n",
      "report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\n",
      "Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\n",
      "falsehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\n",
      "his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\n",
      "was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\n",
      "dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\n",
      "frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\n",
      "and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\n",
      "Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\n",
      "the strength of his attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more\n",
      "painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of\n",
      "concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\n",
      "was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\n",
      "hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\n",
      "impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\n",
      "did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all\n",
      "Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\n",
      "tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\n",
      "reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\n",
      "first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\n",
      "and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\n",
      "from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\n",
      "him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\n",
      "to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any\n",
      "thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and\n",
      "wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\n",
      "Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\n",
      "regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\n",
      "them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\n",
      "whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\n",
      "they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\n",
      "and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\n",
      "complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\n",
      "Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\n",
      "make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\n",
      "better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of\n",
      "making any answer, she went on as before,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\n",

      "\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.\n",
      "How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\n",
      "sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\n",
      "the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\n",
      "time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\n",
      "the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\n",
      "the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\n",
      "writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied\n",
      "the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\n",
      "boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\n",
      "the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\n",
      "letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\n",
      "inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of\n",
      "the latter with regard to new furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\n",
      "heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\n",
      "for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's\n",
      "assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\n",
      "credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\n",
      "had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\n",
      "could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\n",
      "of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave\n",
      "of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\n",
      "the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\n",
      "the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what\n",
      "ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she\n",
      "thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\n",
      "which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\n",
      "could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\n",
      "died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he\n",
      "had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\n",
      "observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\n",
      "materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\n",
      "the same, her peace equally wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\n",
      "Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a\n",
      "longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\n",
      "not help saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no\n",
      "idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\n",
      "will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\n",
      "all be as we were before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed you have no\n",
      "reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\n",
      "acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\n",
      "and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\n",
      "little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\n",
      "that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\n",
      "has done no harm to any one but myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\n",
      "and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\n",
      "you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\n",
      "deserve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\n",
      "the praise on her sister's warm affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\n",
      "world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. _I_ only\n",
      "want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\n",
      "afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\n",
      "privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people\n",
      "whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\n",
      "of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\n",
      "my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\n",
      "little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\n",
      "or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;\n",
      "the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\n",
      "is unaccountable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\n",
      "ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\n",
      "situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\n",
      "Charlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\n",
      "large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\n",
      "ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something\n",
      "like regard and esteem for our cousin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else\n",
      "could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\n",
      "Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\n",
      "understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is\n",
      "a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well\n",
      "as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries\n",
      "him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her,\n",
      "though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one\n",
      "individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\n",
      "endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and\n",
      "insensibility of danger, security for happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\n",
      "Jane, \"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\n",
      "together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\n",
      "mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat\n",
      "you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\n",
      "saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\n",
      "ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\n",
      "to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\n",
      "our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\n",
      "it does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And men take care that they should.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\n",
      "of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,\"\n",
      "said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\n",
      "unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\n",
      "want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,\n",
      "will do the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\n",
      "I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\n",
      "only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\n",
      "secure it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\n",
      "happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\n",
      "may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\n",
      "connections, and pride.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\n",
      "\"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\n",
      "known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\n",
      "her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\n",
      "they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think\n",
      "herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\n",
      "objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\n",
      "to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\n",
      "affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\n",
      "unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\n",
      "mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\n",
      "what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\n",
      "in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's\n",
      "name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\n",
      "more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\n",
      "for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\n",
      "with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\n",
      "she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\n",
      "the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\n",
      "her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\n",
      "the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best\n",
      "comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day,\n",
      "\"your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to\n",
      "being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.\n",
      "It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among\n",
      "her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be\n",
      "long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\n",
      "Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\n",
      "be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\n",
      "all expect Jane's good fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\n",
      "that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always\n",

      "After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\n",
      "Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\n",
      "Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\n",
      "side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason\n",
      "to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\n",
      "would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\n",
      "of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\n",
      "his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\n",
      "another letter of thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\n",
      "brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at\n",
      "Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly\n",
      "superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\n",
      "ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\n",
      "trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well\n",
      "bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\n",
      "woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\n",
      "two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular\n",
      "regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to\n",
      "distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\n",
      "done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\n",
      "had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\n",
      "girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\n",
      "in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr.\n",
      "Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\n",
      "that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it\n",
      "been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\n",
      "and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\n",
      "a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\n",
      "much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\n",

      "them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\n",
      "so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\n",
      "before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\n",
      "greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\n",
      "long sleeves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\n",
      "the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her\n",
      "sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It\n",
      "seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am\n",
      "sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such\n",
      "as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\n",
      "for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\n",
      "her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not\n",
      "do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often happen\n",
      "that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\n",
      "independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in\n",
      "love with only a few days before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so\n",
      "doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\n",
      "often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,\n",
      "as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's\n",
      "love?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite\n",
      "inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\n",
      "they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\n",
      "offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I\n",
      "spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\n",
      "finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\n",
      "Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\n",
      "over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\n",
      "would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\n",
      "would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\n",
      "service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as\n",
      "anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\n",
      "of her sister's ready acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to\n",
      "this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\n",
      "town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\n",
      "out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\n",
      "unless he really comes to see her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\n",
      "friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\n",
      "part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\n",
      "perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would\n",
      "hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\n",
      "impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\n",
      "never stirs without him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\n",
      "correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\n",
      "point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being\n",
      "withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\n",
      "convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\n",
      "hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\n",
      "his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\n",
      "successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\n",
      "attractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the\n",
      "Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she\n",
      "hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,\n",
      "she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\n",
      "seeing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\n",
      "the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\n",
      "engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\n",
      "of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\n",
      "dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\n",
      "made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\n",
      "on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's\n",
      "warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\n",
      "them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\n",
      "of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\n",
      "resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\n",
      "Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\n",
      "an attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\n",
      "unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\n",
      "before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\n",
      "of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\n",
      "acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\n",
      "the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power\n",
      "to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had\n",
      "been in the way of procuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\n",
      "character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\n",
      "of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the\n",
      "minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\n",
      "tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\n",
      "delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\n",
      "present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\n",
      "that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree\n",
      "with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard\n",
      "Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\n",

      "openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\n",
      "yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of\n",
      "fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n",
      "_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\n",
      "ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\n",

      "me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\n",
      "father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\n",
      "should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\n",
      "since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are\n",
      "seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\n",
      "engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\n",

      "I will do my best.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\n",
      "that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\n",
      "so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the\n",
      "necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\n",
      "honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you\n",

      "Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for\n",

      "by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\n",
      "his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was\n",

      "should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\n",
      "address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\n",
      "and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\n",
      "sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\n",
      "were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\n",
      "curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\n",
      "like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\n",
      "be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\n",
      "expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\n",
      "wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\n",
      "which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\n",
      "roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most\n",
      "friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and\n",
      "Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\n",
      "for her own visit there, to know the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\n",

      "\n",
      "Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\n",
      "generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\n",
      "hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\n",
      "her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been\n",
      "lost.\n",

      "She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very\n",
      "glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\n",
      "to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\n",
      "I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\n",
      "engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\n",
      "Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\n",
      "not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\n",
      "soon see them here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that\n",
      "accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\n",
      "persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\n",
      "blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\n",
      "for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\n",
      "visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\n",
      "the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no\n",
      "longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will\n",
      "prove what she felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n",
      "     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have\n",
      "     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my\n",
      "     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\n",
      "     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour\n",
      "     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\n",
      "     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but\n",
      "     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n",
      "     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n",
      "     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When\n",
      "     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;\n",
      "     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said\n",
      "     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so\n",
      "     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly\n",
      "     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\n",
      "     cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\n",
      "     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n",
      "     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n",
      "     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n",
      "     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\n",
      "     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n",

      "     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n",
      "     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\n",
      "     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at\n",
      "     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\n",
      "     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n",
      "     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n",
      "     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\n",
      "     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n",
      "     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n",

      "going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,\n",
      "and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\n",
      "as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\n",
      "Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was\n",
      "novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\n",
      "uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\n",
      "was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\n",
      "a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\n",
      "been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,\n",
      "and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was\n",
      "to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\n",
      "spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\n",
      "perfect as plan could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\n",
      "and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\n",

      "\n",
      "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\n",
      "his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\n",
      "Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\n",
      "first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\n",
      "of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\n",
      "she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\n",
      "opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,\n",
      "there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her\n",
      "to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,\n",
      "that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the\n",
      "amiable and pleasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think\n",
      "him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good\n",
      "humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that\n",
      "could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight\n",
      "as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had\n",
      "known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the\n",
      "wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn\n",
      "out like his information.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\n",
      "as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\n",
      "door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\n",
      "they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\n",
      "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\n",
      "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n",
      "whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\n",
      "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\n",
      "for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\n",
      "kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\n",
      "shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\n",
      "sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\n",
      "her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\n",
      "spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\n",
      "hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\n",
      "particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and\n",
      "repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\n",
      "herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\n",

      "because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\n",
      "girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\n",
      "mercenary.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\n",

      "much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\n",

      "Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\n",
      "Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had\n",
      "seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\n",
      "and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\n",
      "search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\n",
      "The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\n",
      "smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,\n",
      "the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every\n",
      "thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at\n",
      "the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a\n",
      "short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\n",
      "party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the\n",
      "sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest\n",
      "pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when\n",
      "she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her\n",
      "cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility\n",
      "was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate\n",
      "to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,\n",
      "with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,\n",
      "taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he\n",
      "welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble\n",
      "abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\n",
      "fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect\n",
      "and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\n",
      "wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\n",
      "every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\n",
      "by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend\n",
      "that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr.\n",
      "Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\n",
      "which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\n",
      "Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\n",
      "Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every\n",
      "article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to\n",
      "give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,\n",
      "Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\n",
      "and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.\n",
      "To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and\n",
      "Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked\n",
      "of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as\n",
      "much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross\n",
      "walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he\n",
      "asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\n",
      "beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,\n",
      "and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But\n",
      "of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom\n",
      "could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,\n",
      "afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly\n",
      "opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well\n",
      "situated on rising ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,\n",
      "but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\n",
      "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\n",
      "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\n",
      "probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's\n",
      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every\n",
      "thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of\n",
      "which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\n",
      "forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\n",
      "Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n",
      "forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\n",
      "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\n",
      "in, observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\n",
      "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\n",
      "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\n",
      "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\n",
      "service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\n",
      "include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n",
      "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\n",
      "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\n",
      "walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n",
      "_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\n",
      "Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\n",
      "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\n",
      "telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\n",
      "Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon\n",
      "Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\n",
      "and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it\n",
      "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\n",
      "pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\n",
      "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\n",
      "Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\n",
      "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\n",
      "confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up\n",
      "stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the\n",
      "door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\n",
      "agitation, cried out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\n",
      "there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\n",
      "haste, and come down this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\n",
      "and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest\n",
      "of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\n",
      "garden gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs\n",
      "were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\n",
      "daughter!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"La! my dear,\" said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not Lady\n",
      "Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\n",
      "other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\n",
      "creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\n",
      "Why does she not come in?\"\n",

      "when Miss De Bourgh comes in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\n",

      "greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh\n",
      "looked that way.\n",

      "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\n",

      "\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\n",
      "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such\n",
      "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but\n",
      "their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in\n",
      "what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many\n",
      "servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\n",
      "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which\n",
      "becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\n",
      "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion\n",
      "for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\n",
      "being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n",
      "preserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\n",
      "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\n",
      "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of\n",
      "her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\n",
      "who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\n",
      "introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had\n",
      "done to his presentation at St. James's.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\n",
      "across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\n",
      "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\n",
      "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\n",
      "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\n",
      "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\n",
      "cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\n",
      "moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly\n",
      "calm.--Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of\n",
      "Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\n",
      "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she\n",
      "thought she could witness without trepidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\n",
      "rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\n",
      "the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,\n",
      "her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great\n",
      "condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\n",
      "with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was\n",
      "performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\n",
      "which he would have thought necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\n",
      "awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\n",
      "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\n",
      "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\n",
      "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\n",
      "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\n",
      "composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with\n",
      "strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air\n",
      "was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to\n",
      "make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered\n",
      "formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so\n",
      "authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.\n",
      "Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the\n",
      "day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had\n",
      "represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\n",
      "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\n",
      "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her\n",
      "being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any\n",
      "likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\n",
      "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\n",
      "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\n",
      "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\n",
      "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\n",
      "her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,\n",
      "to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its\n",
      "beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much\n",
      "better worth looking at in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\n",
      "and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\n",
      "had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\n",
      "her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\n",
      "nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\n",
      "alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir\n",
      "William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law\n",
      "said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\n",
      "But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\n",
      "gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\n",
      "a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\n",
      "was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\n",
      "between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\n",
      "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\n",
      "dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\n",
      "Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she\n",
      "were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\n",
      "gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\n",
      "done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\n",
      "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\n",
      "subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\n",
      "her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic\n",
      "concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,\n",
      "as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be\n",
      "regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the\n",
      "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\n",
      "beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\n",
      "occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
      "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\n",
      "the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\n",
      "pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters\n",
      "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\n",
      "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\n",
      "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\n",
      "mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\n",
      "questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then\n",
      "observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\n",
      "sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\n",
      "occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought\n",
      "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss\n",
      "Bennet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\n",
      "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\n",
      "some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of them does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned. The Miss\n",
      "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as\n",
      "your's.--Do you draw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, none of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\n",
      "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has your governess left you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never had any governess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\n",
      "without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\n",
      "have been quite a slave to your education.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\n",
      "been the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must\n",
      "have been neglected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\n",
      "wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\n",
      "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\n",
      "idle, certainly might.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\n",
      "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\n",
      "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\n",
      "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\n",
      "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\n",
      "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\n",
      "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\n",
      "it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who\n",
      "was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n",
      "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's\n",
      "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\n",
      "Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\n",
      "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Ma'am, all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the\n",
      "second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your\n",
      "younger sisters must be very young?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\n",
      "in company. But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\n",
      "younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\n",
      "amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\n",
      "marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of\n",
      "youth, as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it\n",
      "would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\n",
      "mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said her Ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\n",
      "decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth smiling, \"your\n",
      "Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\n",
      "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\n",
      "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\n",
      "conceal your age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not one and twenty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\n",
      "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\n",
      "down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\n",
      "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\n",
      "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\n",
      "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\n",
      "expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\n",
      "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\n",
      "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\n",
      "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\n",
      "was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her\n",
      "for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\n",
      "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\n",
      "and noble names.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\n",
      "the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\n",
      "gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\n",
      "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\n",
      "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\n",
      "arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\n",
      "Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As\n",
      "soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\n",
      "cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\n",
      "for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\n",
      "her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\n",
      "satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's\n",
      "praise into his own hands.\n",

      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough\n",
      "to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of\n",
      "her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met\n",
      "with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings\n",
      "to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he\n",
      "went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\n",
      "Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin\n",
      "by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and\n",
      "dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading\n",
      "and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which\n",
      "fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\n",
      "Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\n",
      "the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\n",
      "pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\n",
      "reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\n",
      "much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\n",
      "she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\n",
      "were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\n",
      "along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\n",
      "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\n",
      "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\n",
      "a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\n",
      "prevailed on to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\n",
      "not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\n",
      "and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\n",
      "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\n",
      "hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\n",
      "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\n",
      "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\n",
      "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\n",
      "of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\n",
      "accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\n",
      "out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the\n",
      "commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\n",
      "in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\n",
      "Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\n",
      "quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the\n",
      "village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\n",
      "them into harmony and plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\n",
      "and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card\n",
      "table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of\n",
      "the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of\n",
      "the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach. This\n",
      "however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\n",
      "comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\n",
      "Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\n",
      "had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\n",
      "she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\n",
      "along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\n",
      "a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\n",
      "where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\n",
      "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an\n",
      "addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\n",
      "important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\n",
      "was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were\n",
      "not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n",
      "furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\n",
      "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\n",
      "were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\n",
      "by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest\n",
      "satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\n",
      "seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\n",
      "Miss Lucas and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking\n",
      "the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\n",
      "in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow\n",
      "as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\n",
      "intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\n",
      "respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\n",
      "Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\n",
      "his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\n",
      "them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\n",
      "into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\n",
      "never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\n",
      "before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\n",
      "afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\n",
      "who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\n",
      "address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\n",
      "used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\n",
      "reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\n",
      "friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\n",
      "curtseyed to him, without saying a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\n",
      "readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\n",
      "his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\n",
      "garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.\n",
      "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of\n",
      "Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\n",
      "way, and after a moment's pause, added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\n",
      "happened to see her there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\n",
      "whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\n",
      "Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\n",
      "answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\n",
      "subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\n",
      "away.\n",

      "Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,\n",
      "and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\n",
      "their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\n",
      "received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\n",
      "house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\n",
      "almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\n",
      "such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\n",
      "come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\n",
      "of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\n",
      "at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\n",
      "only seen at church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\n",
      "the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them\n",
      "civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\n",
      "acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\n",
      "almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\n",
      "much more than to any other person in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a\n",
      "welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\n",
      "moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\n",
      "talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\n",
      "at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n",
      "well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\n",
      "spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\n",
      "well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\n",
      "towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a\n",
      "while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\n",
      "scruple to call out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\n",
      "of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are speaking of music, Madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\n",
      "a reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\n",
      "must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\n",
      "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\n",
      "of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I\n",
      "should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\n",
      "had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\n",
      "delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\n",
      "Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\n",
      "if she does not practise a great deal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I assure you, Madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\n",
      "She practises very constantly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\n",
      "to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\n",
      "tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,\n",
      "without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that\n",
      "she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though\n",
      "Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often\n",
      "told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in\n",
      "Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that\n",
      "part of the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made\n",
      "no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\n",
      "promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\n",
      "drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\n",
      "talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\n",
      "her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,\n",
      "stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\n",
      "countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\n",
      "convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\n",
      "me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.\n",
      "There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\n",
      "the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\n",
      "intimidate me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not say that you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could\n",
      "not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\n",
      "have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\n",
      "find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact\n",
      "are not your own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\n",
      "me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\n",
      "in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\n",
      "part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\n",
      "of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\n",
      "all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\n",
      "leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\n",
      "and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\n",
      "The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\n",
      "was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\n",
      "only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was. He danced only\n",
      "four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,\n",
      "more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\n",
      "beyond my own party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\n",
      "introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\n",
      "addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\n",
      "education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\n",
      "himself to strangers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\n",
      "him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\n",
      "\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\n",
      "catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\n",
      "concerns, as I often see done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\n",
      "masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\n",
      "force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\n",
      "have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the\n",
      "trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\n",
      "capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\n",
      "time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can\n",
      "think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\n",
      "what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\n",
      "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\n",
      "to Darcy,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and\n",
      "could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\n",
      "of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\n",
      "been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\n",
      "cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\n",
      "discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\n",
      "De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\n",
      "been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\n",
      "with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\n",
      "them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\n",
      "gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was\n",
      "ready to take them all home.\n",

      "CHAPTER IX.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\n",
      "while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\n",
      "when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\n",
      "visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\n",
      "Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\n",
      "half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\n",
      "when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\n",
      "Darcy only, entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\n",
      "intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\n",
      "be within.\n",
      "\n",
      "They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,\n",
      "seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\n",
      "necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\n",
      "recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\n",
      "curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\n",
      "departure, she observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\n",
      "all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\n",
      "before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly so--I thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short\n",
      "pause, added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\n",
      "returning to Netherfield again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\n",
      "very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\n",
      "at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\n",
      "increasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\n",
      "neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\n",
      "might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did\n",
      "not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\n",
      "for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\n",
      "principle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up, as\n",
      "soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\n",
      "friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\n",
      "trouble of finding a subject to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\n",
      "house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\n",
      "Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\n",
      "kindness on a more grateful object.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\n",
      "the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\n",
      "him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\n",
      "I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\n",
      "thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\n",
      "prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\n",
      "distance of her own family and friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's\n",
      "journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\n",
      "of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\n",
      "was settled _near_ her family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond\n",
      "the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\n",
      "understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\n",
      "Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\n",
      "family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\n",
      "varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of\n",
      "travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\n",
      "case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\n",
      "such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\n",
      "friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\n",
      "the present distance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\n",
      "have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\n",
      "been always at Longbourn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\n",
      "feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\n",
      "glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\n",
      "calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\n",
      "and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised\n",
      "them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\n",
      "on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\n",
      "much to any body, went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can be the meaning of this!\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\n",
      "gone. \"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have\n",
      "called on us in this familiar way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\n",
      "even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\n",
      "conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\n",
      "the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable\n",
      "from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\n",
      "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\n",
      "always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\n",
      "pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\n",
      "two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\n",
      "almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\n",
      "separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\n",
      "aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\n",
      "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\n",
      "him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n",
      "being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\n",
      "former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\n",
      "there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\n",
      "she believed he might have the best informed mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\n",
      "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\n",
      "ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\n",
      "seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\n",
      "propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\n",
      "animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\n",
      "generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\n",
      "her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\n",
      "love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself\n",
      "seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at\n",
      "Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\n",
      "certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\n",
      "look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\n",
      "doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\n",
      "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\n",
      "being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\n",
      "Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\n",
      "raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\n",
      "opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\n",
      "vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he\n",
      "certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\n",
      "to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\n",
      "in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n",

      "\n",
      "More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly\n",
      "meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that\n",
      "should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever\n",
      "happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a\n",
      "favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was\n",
      "very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful\n",
      "ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\n",
      "merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he\n",
      "actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\n",
      "said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of\n",
      "listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\n",
      "that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in\n",
      "being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her\n",
      "not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever\n",
      "she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\n",
      "seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?\n",
      "She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what\n",
      "might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was\n",
      "quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the\n",

      "\"I have been making the tour of the Park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\n",
      "do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\n",
      "you going much farther?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\n",
      "arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\n",
      "great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems\n",
      "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
      "\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\n",
      "many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\n",
      "feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\n",
      "dependence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of\n",
      "either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\n",
      "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\n",
      "wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\n",
      "experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\n",
      "weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\n",
      "where they like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in\n",
      "my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\n",
      "money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\n",
      "idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is\n",
      "the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\n",
      "very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\n",
      "a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\n",
      "she soon afterwards said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\n",
      "having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\n",
      "lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well\n",
      "for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\n",
      "likes with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\n",
      "divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\n",
      "charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a\n",
      "little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\n",
      "may like to have her own way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner\n",
      "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\n",
      "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\n",
      "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\n",
      "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\n",
      "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\n",
      "Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like\n",
      "man--he is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily--\"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\n",
      "Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\n",
      "those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\n",
      "our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\n",
      "him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\n",
      "Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be\n",
      "generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,\n",
      "it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\n",
      "Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself\n",
      "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\n",
      "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n",
      "particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\n",
      "the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n",
      "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\n",
      "lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam smiling. \"He\n",
      "only told me, what I have now told you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\n",
      "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\n",
      "was so thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\n",
      "cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of\n",
      "his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\n",
      "determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.\" \"But,\"\n",
      "she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\n",
      "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\n",
      "that there was much affection in the case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is\n",
      "lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\n",
      "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\n",
      "matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n",
      "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\n",
      "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\n",
      "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n",
      "could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n",
      "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n",
      "taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\n",
      "had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\n",
      "arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n",
      "_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that\n",
      "Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\n",
      "while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\n",
      "in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\n",
      "inflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her\n",
      "having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\n",
      "business in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\n",
      "objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\n",
      "excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\n",
      "any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some\n",
      "peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\n",
      "and respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought\n",
      "of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would\n",
      "not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\n",
      "Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\n",
      "the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want\n",
      "of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly\n",
      "governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\n",
      "retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\n",
      "headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\n",
      "her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\n",
      "cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\n",
      "seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\n",
      "as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins\n",
      "could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\n",
      "displeased by her staying at home.\n",

      "CHAPTER XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\n",
      "much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\n",
      "examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\n",
      "being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\n",
      "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\n",
      "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\n",
      "cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\n",
      "proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\n",
      "disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\n",
      "noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\n",
      "attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\n",
      "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a\n",
      "keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to\n",
      "think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\n",
      "and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\n",
      "with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\n",
      "spirits, by all that affection could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that\n",
      "his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\n",
      "that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\n",
      "mean to be unhappy about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\n",
      "door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\n",
      "being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\n",
      "the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But\n",
      "this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\n",
      "affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\n",
      "room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her\n",
      "health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\n",
      "She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\n",
      "then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said\n",
      "not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an\n",
      "agitated manner, and thus began,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\n",
      "repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\n",
      "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\n",
      "and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,\n",
      "immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides\n",
      "those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the\n",
      "subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\n",
      "its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had\n",
      "always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\n",
      "due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\n",
      "recommend his suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n",
      "the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\n",
      "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n",
      "receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\n",
      "all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\n",
      "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\n",
      "representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of\n",
      "all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\n",
      "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\n",
      "his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of\n",
      "a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\n",
      "countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\n",
      "exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her\n",
      "cheeks, and she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n",
      "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n",
      "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\n",
      "felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n",
      "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n",
      "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any\n",
      "one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of\n",
      "short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the\n",
      "acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming\n",
      "it after this explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed\n",
      "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\n",
      "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\n",
      "his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n",
      "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed\n",
      "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\n",
      "dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\n",
      "might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n",
      "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I might as well enquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a design of\n",
      "offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n",
      "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n",
      "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\n",
      "against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\n",
      "favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n",
      "the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\n",
      "happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n",
      "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n",
      "continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n",
      "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n",
      "you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n",
      "of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\n",
      "world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\n",
      "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n",
      "kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n",
      "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied, \"I have no wish of denying\n",
      "that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your\n",
      "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n",
      "kinder than towards myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n",
      "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\n",
      "is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\n",
      "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n",
      "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n",
      "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy in\n",
      "a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\n",
      "interest in him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\n",
      "have been great indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\n",
      "him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have\n",
      "withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for\n",
      "him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence\n",
      "which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and\n",
      "yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and\n",
      "ridicule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n",
      "\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\n",
      "thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n",
      "calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in his\n",
      "walk, and turning towards her, \"these offences might have been\n",
      "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n",
      "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n",
      "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy\n",
      "concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being\n",
      "impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n",
      "reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\n",
      "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?\n",
      "To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life\n",
      "is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n",
      "the utmost to speak with composure when she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n",
      "declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the\n",
      "concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\n",
      "more gentleman-like manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\n",
      "that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",
      "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my\n",
      "acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\n",
      "feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of\n",
      "disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n",
      "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n",

      "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n",
      "she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.\n",
      "The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed\n",

      "Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now\n",
      "near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\n",
      "her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in\n",
      "a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\n",
      "gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,\n",
      "which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, \"I\n",

      "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\"--And then, with a\n",

      "     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n",
      "     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n",

      "     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n",
      "     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n",
      "     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n",
      "     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n",
      "     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,\n",
      "     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n",
      "     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then\n",
      "     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had\n",
      "     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n",
      "     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n",
      "     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n",
      "     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n",
      "     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n",
      "     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have\n",
      "     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n",
      "     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n",
      "     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n",
      "     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n",
      "     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n",
      "     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n",
      "     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n",
      "     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n",
      "     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n",
      "     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n",
      "     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n",
      "     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n",
      "     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n",
      "     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n",
      "     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n",
      "     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n",
      "     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n",
      "     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n",
      "     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n",
      "     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n",
      "     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n",
      "     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n",
      "     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n",
      "     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst\n",
      "     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n",
      "     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n",
      "     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n",
      "     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n",
      "     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n",
      "     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n",
      "     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n",
      "     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n",
      "     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n",
      "     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n",
      "     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n",
      "     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n",
      "     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n",
      "     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n",
      "     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n",
      "     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n",
      "     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n",
      "     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n",
      "     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n",
      "     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n",
      "     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n",
      "     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n",
      "     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n",
      "     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n",
      "     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n",
      "     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n",
      "     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\n",
      "     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n",
      "     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n",
      "     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the\n",
      "     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n",
      "     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n",
      "     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as\n",
      "     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n",
      "     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n",
      "     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n",
      "     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n",
      "     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n",
      "     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n",
      "     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's\n",
      "     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n",
      "     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have\n",
      "     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more\n",
      "     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only\n",
      "     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my\n",
      "     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but\n",
      "     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n",
      "     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very\n",
      "     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the\n",
      "     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his\n",
      "     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on\n",
      "     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore\n",
      "     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n",
      "     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own\n",
      "     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\n",
      "     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not\n",
      "     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n",
      "     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n",
      "     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\n",
      "     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n",
      "     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the\n",
      "     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge\n",
      "     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man\n",
      "     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of\n",
      "     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.\n",
      "     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\n",
      "     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\n",
      "     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\n",
      "     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n",
      "     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to\n",
      "     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n",
      "     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n",
      "     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n",
      "     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n",
      "     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own\n",
      "     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these\n",
      "     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally\n",
      "     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\n",
      "     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\n",
      "     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
      "     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n",
      "     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n",
      "     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than\n",
      "     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to\n",
      "     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a\n",
      "     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all\n",
      "     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n",
      "     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n",
      "     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I\n",
      "     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\n",
      "     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\n",
      "     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\n",
      "     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n",
      "     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n",
      "     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n",
      "     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he\n",
      "     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n",
      "     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
      "     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n",
      "     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n",
      "     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n",
      "     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n",
      "     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to\n",
      "     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.\n",
      "     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his\n",
      "     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n",
      "     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every\n",
      "     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But\n",
      "     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I\n",
      "     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n",
      "     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce\n",
      "     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no\n",
      "     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my\n",
      "     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel\n",
      "     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from\n",
      "     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n",
      "     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n",
      "     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n",
      "     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n",
      "     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n",
      "     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n",
      "     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n",
      "     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n",
      "     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but\n",
      "     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n",
      "     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n",
      "     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\n",
      "     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea\n",
      "     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\n",
      "     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n",
      "     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n",
      "     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left\n",
      "     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from\n",
      "     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n",
      "     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n",
      "     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n",
      "     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.\n",
      "     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n",
      "     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n",
      "     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n",
      "     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n",
      "     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n",

      "Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\n",
      "she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\n",
      "and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to\n",
      "give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\n",
      "prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of\n",
      "what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which\n",
      "hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing\n",
      "what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\n",
      "sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's\n",
      "insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of\n",
      "the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have\n",
      "any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had\n",
      "done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It\n",
      "was all pride and insolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when\n",
      "she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,\n",
      "if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\n",
      "bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings\n",
      "were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n",
      "Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\n",
      "to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\n",
      "This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had\n",
      "gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the\n",
      "last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\n",
      "regard it, that she would never look in it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\n",
      "nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\n",
      "was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\n",
      "again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\n",
      "commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\n",
      "The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly\n",
      "what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\n",
      "own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to\n",
      "the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\n",
      "was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\n",
      "impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n",
      "other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\n",
      "not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the\n",
      "particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\n",
      "to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three\n",
      "thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\n",
      "letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\n",
      "impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\n",
      "little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\n",
      "But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\n",
      "believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to\n",
      "render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\n",
      "turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\n",
      "bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\n",
      "entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\n",
      "persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\n",
      "had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\n",
      "nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to\n",
      "his real character, had information been in her power, she had never\n",
      "felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had\n",
      "established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to\n",
      "recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\n",
      "integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\n",
      "Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\n",
      "casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy\n",
      "had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no\n",
      "such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\n",
      "her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\n",
      "substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\n",
      "the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\n",
      "pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\n",
      "read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,\n",
      "received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\n",
      "Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\n",
      "referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\n",
      "himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\n",
      "near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no\n",
      "reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\n",
      "him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\n",
      "at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\n",
      "have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\n",
      "cousin's corroboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation\n",
      "between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.\n",
      "Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\n",
      "struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\n",
      "wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\n",
      "himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\n",
      "with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\n",
      "of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n",
      "_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\n",
      "the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield\n",
      "family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\n",
      "herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where\n",
      "discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.\n",
      "Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the\n",
      "father, would always prevent his exposing the son.\n",
      "\n",
      "How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!\n",
      "His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\n",
      "hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\n",
      "the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.\n",
      "His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\n",
      "either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\n",
      "his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\n",
      "incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\n",
      "and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\n",
      "but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\n",
      "asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\n",
      "were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\n",
      "acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\n",
      "together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing\n",
      "that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him\n",
      "of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was\n",
      "esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\n",
      "brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of\n",
      "his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had\n",
      "his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\n",
      "every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\n",
      "that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\n",
      "as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\n",

      "prejudiced, absurd.\n",
      "\n",

      "vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this\n",
      "discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could\n",
      "not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\n",
      "folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\n",
      "of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\n",

      "From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\n",
      "which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\n",
      "_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\n",
      "different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that\n",
      "credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\n",
      "give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally\n",
      "unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help\n",
      "remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she\n",
      "deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's\n",

      "They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\n",

      "with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of\n",
      "extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\n",
      "what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\n",
      "truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\n",

      "as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\n",
      "that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\n",

      "such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though\n",
      "evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to\n",

      "Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\n",
      "vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\n",
      "to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\n",
      "in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;\n",

      "It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\n",
      "together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;\n",
      "and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was\n",
      "to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's\n",
      "punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up\n",
      "stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily\n",
      "employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on\n",
      "guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\n",
      "out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\n",
      "\"Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia; \"but you must lend us the\n",
      "money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\" Then shewing\n",
      "her purchases: \"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\n",
      "is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\n",
      "pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\n",
      "better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\n",
      "unconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\n",
      "when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\n",
      "think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\n",
      "one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\n",
      "are going in a fortnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they indeed?\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\n",
      "take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\n",
      "and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to\n",
      "go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\n",
      "have!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\n",
      "and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole\n",
      "campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\n",
      "regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat down to\n",

      "a certain person that we all like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\n",
      "need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\n",
      "waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\n",
      "things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\n",
      "he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\n",
      "my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\n",
      "There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She\n",
      "is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection\n",
      "imprudent as to fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it he never cared\n",
      "three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\n",
      "thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\n",
      "coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\n",
      "was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\n",
      "liberal!\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\n",
      "ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\n",
      "boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and\n",
      "Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nicely we are crammed in!\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I bought my\n",
      "bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now\n",
      "let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\n",
      "home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,\n",
      "since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\n",
      "flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\n",
      "before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\n",
      "She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\n",
      "being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\n",
      "get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\n",
      "Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\n",
      "how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\n",
      "chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\n",
      "of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend\n",
      "the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\n",
      "evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\n",
      "she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\n",
      "was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\n",
      "dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a\n",
      "lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs.\n",
      "Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\n",
      "one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\n",
      "and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\n",
      "did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\n",
      "Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\n",
      "something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,\n",
      "assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\n",
      "companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\n",
      "could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\n",
      "in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\n",
      "say voluntarily to Elizabeth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\n",
      "came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects\n",
      "which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,\n",
      "after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was\n",
      "doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\n",
      "fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\n",
      "retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\n",
      "rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various\n",
      "pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\n",
      "as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\n",
      "there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\n",
      "Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\n",
      "behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\n",
      "cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\n",
      "treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\n",
      "we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\n",
      "And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\n",
      "loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this, Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\n",
      "to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with\n",
      "the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms\n",
      "for _me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any\n",
      "body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\n",
      "Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\n",
      "the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\n",
      "home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\n",
      "another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,\n",
      "and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_,\n",
      "of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In\n",
      "a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be\n",
      "nothing more to plague her on his account.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\n",
      "scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\n",
      "frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\n",
      "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\n",
      "at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\n",
      "disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\n",
      "longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\n",
      "in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\n",
      "she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\n",
      "Darcy and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\n",
      "partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\n",
      "natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\n",
      "sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\n",
      "little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\n",
      "unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,\" said she; \"and certainly\n",

      "\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\n",

      "\"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\n",
      "next day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\n",
      "as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\n",
      "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\n",
      "so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\n",
      "collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\n",
      "grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\n",
      "Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\n",
      "seek to clear one, without involving the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth. \"You never will be able to make both\n",
      "of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\n",
      "with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\n",
      "enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\n",
      "about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\n",
      "Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so\n",
      "very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only\n",
      "consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\n",
      "knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of\n",
      "his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it\n",
      "so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\n",
      "full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\n",
      "growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\n",
      "makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\n",
      "be as light as a feather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his\n",
      "countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\n",
      "two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\n",
      "appearance of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\n",
      "used to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\n",
      "to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an\n",
      "opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\n",
      "abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing\n",
      "at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\n",
      "the matter as you do now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very\n",
      "uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I\n",
      "felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\n",
      "vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\n",
      "in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\n",
      "undeserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most\n",
      "natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\n",
      "one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\n",
      "ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand\n",
      "Wickham's character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, \"Surely there can be no\n",
      "occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to\n",
      "make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative\n",
      "to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and\n",
      "if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who\n",
      "will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,\n",
      "that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to\n",
      "attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham\n",
      "will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,\n",
      "what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we\n",
      "may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will\n",
      "say nothing about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\n",
      "ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\n",
      "re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\n",
      "got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\n",
      "and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\n",
      "to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\n",
      "of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\n",
      "half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\n",
      "had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could\n",
      "partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\n",
      "understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this\n",
      "last incumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\n",
      "improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell\n",
      "what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The\n",
      "liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\n",
      "state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\n",
      "very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\n",
      "love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\n",
      "her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\n",
      "boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to\n",
      "every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\n",
      "feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\n",
      "regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their\n",
      "tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of\n",
      "this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak\n",
      "of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I\n",
      "cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a\n",
      "very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\n",
      "chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\n",
      "coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every\n",
      "body too, who is likely to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\n",
      "shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was\n",
      "her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\n",
      "Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\n",
      "has done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\n",
      "she made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother soon afterwards, \"and so the\n",
      "Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\n",
      "will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\n",
      "excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\n",
      "she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\n",
      "housekeeping, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, nothing at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\n",
      "take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\n",
      "for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\n",
      "talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\n",
      "quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they\n",
      "often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\n",
      "estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be\n",
      "ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\n",
      "the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\n",
      "the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\n",
      "universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\n",
      "and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\n",
      "frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\n",
      "Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\n",
      "hard-heartedness in any of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!\" would they\n",
      "often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so,\n",
      "Lizzy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\n",
      "she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years\n",
      "ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel\n",
      "Millar's regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I shall break _mine_,\" said Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\n",
      "disagreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\"\n",
      "added Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\n",
      "Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\n",
      "of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's\n",
      "objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\n",
      "interference in the views of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\n",
      "received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the\n",
      "regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\n",
      "very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour\n",
      "and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\n",
      "their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\n",
      "the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\n",
      "to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew\n",
      "about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's\n",
      "congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\n",
      "whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\n",
      "in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\"\n",
      "said she, \"though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\n",
      "right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\n",
      "her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\n",
      "exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\n",
      "considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\n",
      "for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\n",
      "known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\n",
      "go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\n",
      "behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\n",
      "such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\n",
      "imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\n",
      "be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\n",
      "place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\n",
      "expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\n",
      "circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to\n",
      "us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and\n",
      "imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\n",
      "would judge differently in the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Already arisen!\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away\n",
      "some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\n",
      "squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,\n",
      "are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\n",
      "who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\n",
      "of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\n",
      "importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\n",
      "wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\n",
      "Lydia's character. Excuse me--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\n",
      "father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\n",
      "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\n",
      "her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\n",
      "will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\n",
      "that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the\n",
      "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\n",
      "youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of\n",
      "her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n",
      "contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\n",
      "is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\n",
      "ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you\n",
      "suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\n",
      "they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\n",
      "disgrace?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and\n",
      "affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\n",
      "you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\n",
      "advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly\n",
      "sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\n",
      "Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\n",
      "keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n",
      "object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance\n",
      "even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\n",
      "women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\n",
      "there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\n",
      "many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest\n",
      "of her life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\n",
      "continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\n",
      "in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.\n",
      "She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over\n",
      "unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\n",
      "disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\n",
      "father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\n",
      "united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\n",
      "every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of\n",
      "fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She\n",
      "saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at\n",
      "present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents\n",
      "stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\n",
      "and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she\n",
      "saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\n",
      "officers at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\n",
      "such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\n",
      "have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\n",
      "same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\n",
      "melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\n",
      "continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving\n",
      "home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\n",
      "frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\n",
      "well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\n",
      "learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\n",
      "an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\n",
      "behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\n",
      "for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\n",
      "had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after\n",
      "what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\n",
      "finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\n",
      "gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\n",
      "reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\n",
      "cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified\n",
      "and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined\n",
      "with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\n",
      "disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\n",
      "enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\n",
      "mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\n",
      "weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\n",
      "recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\n",
      "him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,\n",
      "asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\n",
      "With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, \"How long did you\n",
      "say that he was at Rosings?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearly three weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you saw him frequently?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, almost every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And pray\n",
      "may I ask?\" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, \"Is it in\n",
      "address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his\n",
      "ordinary style? for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower and more\n",
      "serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\n",
      "what he ever was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\n",
      "rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\n",
      "something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\n",
      "and anxious attention, while she added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\n",
      "either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from\n",
      "knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\n",
      "look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\n",
      "embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\n",
      "accents,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\n",
      "comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\n",
      "even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\n",
      "may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\n",
      "him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\n",
      "the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,\n",
      "is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\n",
      "judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I\n",
      "know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\n",
      "wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he\n",
      "has very much at heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\n",
      "slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\n",
      "the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\n",
      "him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\n",
      "of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish\n",
      "Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\n",
      "mutual desire of never meeting again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\n",
      "from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\n",
      "between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\n",
      "only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\n",
      "and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\n",
      "opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there\n",
      "was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous\n",
      "happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\n",
      "of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\n",
      "not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\n",
      "comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\n",
      "of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\n",
      "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in\n",
      "their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\n",
      "esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of\n",
      "domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\n",
      "disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\n",
      "imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\n",
      "console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\n",
      "the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\n",
      "enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\n",
      "her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\n",
      "the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\n",
      "wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\n",
      "philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\n",
      "father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\n",
      "respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\n",
      "herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n",
      "banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\n",
      "and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\n",
      "children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\n",
      "strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\n",
      "unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils\n",
      "arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly\n",
      "used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\n",
      "even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little\n",
      "other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\n",
      "abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\n",
      "sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around\n",
      "them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\n",
      "might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\n",
      "of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\n",
      "greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\n",
      "folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering\n",
      "place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been\n",
      "sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward\n",
      "with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the\n",
      "satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\n",
      "name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\n",
      "some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\n",
      "again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\n",
      "present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\n",
      "was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\n",
      "for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her\n",
      "mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in\n",
      "the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for.\n",
      "Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\n",
      "But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\n",
      "sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\n",
      "pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can\n",
      "never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\n",
      "the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely\n",
      "to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\n",
      "always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that\n",
      "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\n",
      "had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\n",
      "made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\n",
      "she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\n",
      "violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\n",
      "camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less\n",
      "to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\n",
      "too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\n",
      "humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore\n",
      "a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\n",
      "back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\n",
      "was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June\n",
      "Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\n",
      "tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by\n",
      "the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\n",
      "mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious\n",
      "arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in\n",
      "Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast\n",
      "approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\n",
      "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\n",
      "curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\n",
      "setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\n",
      "within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\n",
      "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n",
      "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\n",
      "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\n",
      "present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\n",
      "county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three\n",
      "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\n",
      "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\n",
      "they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\n",
      "her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\n",
      "Dovedale, or the Peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\n",
      "the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\n",
      "was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\n",
      "and all was soon right again.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\n",
      "impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\n",
      "owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity,\n",
      "and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\n",
      "before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\n",
      "Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\n",
      "younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\n",
      "Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\n",
      "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\n",
      "way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\n",
      "morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\n",
      "enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\n",
      "suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\n",
      "inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\n",
      "and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\n",
      "disappointments abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\n",
      "nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\n",
      "lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c. are\n",
      "sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\n",
      "concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's\n",
      "former residence, and where she had lately learned that some\n",
      "acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\n",
      "all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\n",
      "Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\n",
      "was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\n",
      "talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\n",
      "inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\n",
      "willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\n",
      "much?\" said her aunt. \"A place too, with which so many of your\n",
      "acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\n",
      "must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,\n",
      "she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house\n",
      "richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but the\n",
      "grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\n",
      "country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\n",
      "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\n",
      "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\n",
      "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run\n",
      "such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally\n",
      "resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as\n",
      "to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",
      "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\n",
      "proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\n",
      "the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\n",
      "alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n",
      "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\n",
      "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\n",
      "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\n",
      "to the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\n",
      "Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\n",
      "in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\n",
      "entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\n",
      "a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\n",
      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\n",
      "half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\n",
      "woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
      "were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that\n",
      "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
      "\n",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n",
      "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\n",
      "hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n",
      "wonder at her being where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less\n",
      "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\n",
      "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\n",
      "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\n",
      "which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\n",
      "distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\n",
      "good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\n",
      "on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\n",
      "it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\n",
      "taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to\n",
      "be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable\n",
      "to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration\n",
      "of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\n",
      "splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\n",
      "these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,\"--recollecting\n",
      "herself,--\"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost\n",
      "to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really\n",
      "absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\n",
      "asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "replied, that he was, adding, \"but we expect him to-morrow, with a\n",
      "large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\n",
      "journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\n",
      "the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\n",
      "over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\n",
      "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a\n",
      "young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been\n",
      "brought up by him at his own expence.--\"He is now gone into the army,\"\n",
      "she added, \"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n",
      "return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n",
      "\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\n",
      "other--about eight years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\n",
      "us whether it is like or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n",
      "intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured, and said--\"A little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\n",
      "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\n",
      "master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n",
      "be then. He was very fond of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n",
      "when she was only eight years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n",
      "accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\n",
      "new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\n",
      "comes here to-morrow with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n",
      "communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\n",
      "from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n",
      "master and his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\n",
      "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\n",
      "good enough for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\n",
      "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows\n",
      "him,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\n",
      "and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n",
      "\"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\n",
      "ever since he was four years old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n",
      "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest\n",
      "opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,\n",
      "and was grateful to her uncle for saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\n",
      "having such a master.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not\n",
      "meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\n",
      "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\n",
      "was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the\n",
      "world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth almost stared at her.--\"Can this be Mr. Darcy!\" thought she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\n",
      "as affable to the poor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\n",
      "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject\n",
      "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n",
      "furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",
      "prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n",
      "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n",
      "many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\n",
      "lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\n",
      "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\n",
      "give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\n",
      "saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\n",
      "away like other young men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt, as they walked, \"is not\n",
      "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very\n",
      "pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\n",
      "lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but\n",
      "just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the\n",
      "room, when last at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n",
      "one of the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\n",
      "the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added.--\"Whatever\n",
      "can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\n",
      "is nothing he would not do for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\n",
      "all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings;\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
      "Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
      "also more intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\n",
      "of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\n",
      "arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\n",
      "such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\n",
      "when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in\n",
      "earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\n",
      "gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\n",
      "father's life time.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\n",
      "sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of\n",
      "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
      "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
      "considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of\n",
      "good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\n",
      "forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\n",
      "stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\n",
      "upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\n",
      "gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n",
      "softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",
      "they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n",
      "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was\n",
      "conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\n",
      "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
      "of perfect civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
      "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\n",
      "returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the\n",
      "alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\n",
      "uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few\n",
      "minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most\n",
      "uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\n",
      "spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\n",
      "enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\n",
      "in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
      "leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\n",
      "figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\n",
      "feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\n",
      "vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\n",
      "thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\n",
      "disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\n",
      "she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\n",
      "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\n",
      "only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n",
      "discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\n",
      "moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\n",
      "again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n",
      "strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\n",
      "her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her\n",
      "family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\n",
      "never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when\n",
      "he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to\n",
      "account for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\n",
      "to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\n",
      "her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
      "roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be\n",
      "beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n",
      "miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n",
      "the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n",
      "it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n",
      "met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,\n",
      "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\n",
      "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\n",
      "but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\n",
      "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\n",
      "Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour\n",
      "changed, and she said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
      "her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\n",
      "she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\n",
      "revolted, in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\n",
      "she, \"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\n",
      "fashion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
      "it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
      "connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so\n",
      "far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had\n",
      "some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
      "chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\n",
      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
      "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\n",
      "wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\n",
      "compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From\n",
      "what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\n",
      "work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n",
      "brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
      "Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
      "her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
      "together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to\n",
      "know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
      "very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\n",
      "the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned\n",
      "between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\n",
      "not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\n",
      "pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow\n",
      "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n",
      "during your stay at Lambton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n",
      "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\n",
      "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n",
      "him think really ill of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\n",
      "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n",
      "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of\n",
      "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\n",
      "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n",
      "mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\n",
      "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might\n",
      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
      "there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\n",
      "she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with\n",
      "great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\n",
      "and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the\n",
      "house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted\n",
      "on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies\n",
      "into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\n",
      "slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n",
      "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.\n",
      "\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,\" replied her\n",
      "aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\n",
      "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n",
      "_I_ have seen nothing of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\n",
      "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n",
      "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n",
      "or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are\n",
      "perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\n",
      "disagreeable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\n",
      "him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n",
      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\n",
      "her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n",
      "at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\n",
      "warn me off his grounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\n",
      "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n",
      "any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured\n",
      "look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when\n",
      "he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that\n",
      "would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure,\n",
      "the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming\n",
      "character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a\n",
      "liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant\n",
      "comprehends every virtue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\n",
      "his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as\n",
      "guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\n",
      "relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
      "Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",
      "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\n",
      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\n",
      "any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had\n",
      "no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",
      "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\n",
      "intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\n",
      "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\n",
      "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above\n",
      "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\n",
      "her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\n",
      "resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\n",
      "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\n",
      "arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\n",
      "place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\n",
      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\n",
      "curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the\n",
      "livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\n",
      "to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",
      "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\n",
      "that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\n",
      "a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\n",
      "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\n",
      "Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\n",
      "at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she\n",
      "dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\n",
      "her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\n",
      "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks\n",
      "of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new\n",
      "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\n",
      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\n",
      "was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was\n",
      "also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\n",
      "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step\n",
      "was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
      "Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she\n",
      "still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the\n",
      "unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her\n",
      "again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\n",
      "and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever\n",
      "done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\n",
      "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\n",
      "them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\n",
      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\n",
      "each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from\n",
      "those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\n",
      "it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in\n",
      "doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\n",
      "evident enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\n",
      "feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\n",
      "make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\n",
      "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\n",
      "endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\n",
      "was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\n",
      "how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a\n",
      "like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on\n",
      "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that\n",
      "as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though\n",
      "this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour\n",
      "to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared\n",
      "on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between\n",
      "them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was\n",
      "soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they\n",
      "parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of\n",
      "Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\n",
      "might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a\n",
      "moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had\n",
      "something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had\n",
      "the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply, he added, \"It\n",
      "is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when\n",
      "we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\n",
      "took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\n",
      "whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the\n",
      "question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner\n",
      "which gave them meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,\n",
      "whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\n",
      "complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\n",
      "removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\n",
      "the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however\n",
      "temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\n",
      "she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion\n",
      "of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\n",
      "disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n",
      "very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\n",
      "lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so\n",
      "great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\n",
      "restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\n",
      "of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\n",
      "Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\n",
      "self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could\n",
      "result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n",
      "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\n",
      "down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\n",
      "Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose\n",
      "to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\n",
      "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\n",
      "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\n",
      "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n",
      "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\n",
      "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\n",
      "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\n",
      "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than\n",
      "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\n",
      "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\n",
      "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\n",
      "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to\n",
      "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\n",
      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on\n",
      "this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors\n",
      "left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her\n",
      "uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their\n",
      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\n",
      "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\n",
      "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\n",
      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",
      "interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",
      "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\n",
      "not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character\n",
      "from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,\n",
      "would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,\n",
      "that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of\n",
      "their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They\n",
      "had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if\n",
      "not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\n",
      "market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,\n",
      "however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the\n",
      "son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known\n",
      "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\n",
      "him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\n",
      "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\n",
      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\n",
      "she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his\n",
      "favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
      "there was a motive within her of good will which could not be\n",
      "overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once\n",
      "loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the\n",
      "petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\n",
      "unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\n",
      "persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\n",
      "accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\n",
      "any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\n",
      "their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\n",
      "of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a\n",
      "change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\n",
      "gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\n",
      "its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\n",
      "unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she\n",
      "esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\n",
      "welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\n",
      "depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\n",
      "that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\n",
      "possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\n",
      "such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very\n",
      "day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late\n",
      "breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\n",
      "some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\n",
      "would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\n",
      "morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,\n",
      "when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\n",
      "renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\n",
      "some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\n",
      "originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\n",
      "her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with\n",
      "how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be\n",
      "renewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,\n",
      "whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\n",
      "opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\n",
      "hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts\n",
      "which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\n",
      "with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\n",
      "London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with\n",
      "all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\n",
      "fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\n",
      "inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\n",
      "her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and\n",
      "on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\n",
      "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\n",
      "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\n",
      "of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\n",
      "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\n",
      "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\n",
      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\n",
      "short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\n",
      "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\n",
      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\n",
      "of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\n",
      "feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\n",
      "Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\n",
      "enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\n",
      "significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\n",
      "party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\n",
      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\n",
      "them round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\n",
      "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\n",
      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\n",
      "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\n",
      "regret that he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\n",
      "They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\n",
      "instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\n",
      "various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\n",
      "but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\n",
      "presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\n",
      "she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened\n",
      "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\n",
      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",
      "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\n",
      "refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\n",
      "Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\n",
      "her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\n",
      "Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\n",
      "absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\n",
      "corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated\n",
      "elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\n",
      "possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\n",
      "brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\n",
      "which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\n",
      "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\n",
      "meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\n",
      "Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\n",
      "for the welfare of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\n",
      "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\n",
      "Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\n",
      "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\n",
      "recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\n",
      "had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\n",
      "fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\n",
      "above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\n",
      "carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\n",
      "Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join\n",
      "her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his\n",
      "judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\n",
      "to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\n",
      "lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\n",
      "could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to\n",
      "his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried; \"I\n",
      "never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.\n",
      "She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\n",
      "should not have known her again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\n",
      "himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\n",
      "her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\n",
      "summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see\n",
      "any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\n",
      "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\n",
      "character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\n",
      "tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\n",
      "have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing\n",
      "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\n",
      "like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\n",
      "without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\n",
      "the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\n",
      "wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\n",
      "success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a\n",
      "determination of making him speak, she continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\n",
      "were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\n",
      "your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\n",
      "a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\n",
      "seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n",
      "one time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\n",
      "was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have\n",
      "considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\n",
      "having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during\n",
      "their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested\n",
      "them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were\n",
      "discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.\n",
      "They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every\n",
      "thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner\n",

      "on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the\n",
      "receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\n",

      "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\n",

      "themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been\n",
      "written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\n",
      "little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\n",
      "but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\n",
      "agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\n",

      "     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming\n",
      "     you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to\n",
      "     poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were\n",
      "     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was\n",
      "     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,\n",
      "     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not\n",

      "     his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I\n",
      "     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)\n",
      "     marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,\n",
      "     for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother\n",
      "     is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,\n",
      "     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must\n",
      "     forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as\n",
      "     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\n",
      "     eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must\n",
      "     have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason\n",
      "     to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,\n",
      "     informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be\n",

      "     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\n",
      "     for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\n",

      "     that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which\n",
      "     was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off\n",
      "     from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to\n",
      "     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed\n",
      "     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them\n",
      "     from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen\n",
      "     to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making\n",
      "     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into\n",
      "     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at\n",
      "     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such\n",

      "     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\n",
      "     most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and\n",
      "     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my\n",
      "     dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,\n",
      "     but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it\n",
      "     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n",
      "     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design\n",
      "     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\n",

      "     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\n",
      "     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\n",
      "     feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill\n",
      "     and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but\n",
      "     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life\n",
      "     saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n",
      "     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot\n",
      "     wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n",
      "     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\n",
      "     is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so\n",
      "     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I\n",
      "     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\n",
      "     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\n",
      "     you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and\n",
      "     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\n",
      "     still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to\n",
      "     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What\n",
      "     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\n",
      "     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\n",
      "     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\n",
      "     to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\n",
      "     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately\n",
      "     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\n",
      "as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\n",
      "moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\n",
      "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\n",
      "manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to\n",
      "speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\n",
      "situation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\n",
      "I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\n",
      "delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\n",
      "politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute,\n",
      "but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\n",
      "not well enough;--you cannot go yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\n",
      "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\n",
      "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\n",
      "accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\n",
      "mistress home, instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\n",
      "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\n",
      "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n",
      "\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you\n",
      "present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very\n",
      "ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I thank you;\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\n",
      "is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by\n",
      "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\n",
      "not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\n",
      "something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\n",
      "silence. At length, she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from\n",
      "Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My\n",
      "youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown\n",
      "herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together\n",
      "from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no\n",
      "money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for\n",
      "ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added, in a yet\n",
      "more agitated voice, \"that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew\n",
      "what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what\n",
      "I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\n",
      "have happened. But it is all, all too late now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\n",
      "certain, absolutely certain?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\n",
      "almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\n",
      "Scotland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\n",
      "immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\n",
      "nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\n",
      "such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\n",
      "not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what\n",
      "I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\n",
      "much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\n",
      "and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\n",
      "gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\n",
      "was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family\n",
      "weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\n",
      "wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\n",
      "consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\n",
      "was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\n",
      "wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n",
      "him, as now, when all love must be vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\n",
      "humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\n",
      "every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\n",
      "Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\n",
      "several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\n",
      "voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\n",
      "compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\n",
      "long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my\n",
      "stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any\n",
      "thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer\n",
      "consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain\n",
      "wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This\n",
      "unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure\n",
      "of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\n",
      "urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\n",
      "long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for\n",
      "her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\n",
      "reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\n",
      "one serious, parting, look, went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\n",
      "should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\n",
      "marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\n",
      "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\n",
      "contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\n",
      "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\n",
      "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\n",
      "change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\n",
      "otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\n",
      "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\n",
      "first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\n",
      "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\n",
      "somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\n",
      "and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\n",
      "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\n",
      "with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\n",
      "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\n",
      "business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\n",
      "a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\n",
      "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\n",
      "of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first\n",
      "letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\n",
      "Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\n",
      "money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\n",
      "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\n",
      "as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\n",
      "suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\n",
      "intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\n",
      "her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\n",
      "prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\n",
      "Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\n",
      "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one\n",
      "officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions\n",
      "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\n",
      "fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\n",
      "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now\n",
      "feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to\n",
      "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\n",
      "family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\n",
      "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\n",
      "could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\n",
      "importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience\n",
      "was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\n",
      "by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\n",
      "satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\n",
      "cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\n",
      "the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\n",
      "never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\n",
      "deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\n",
      "the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\n",
      "promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no\n",
      "less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\n",
      "by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily\n",
      "settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be\n",
      "done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was\n",
      "here when you sent for us;--was it so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
      "_That_ is all settled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is all settled;\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\n",
      "prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\n",
      "truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the\n",
      "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\n",
      "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\n",
      "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\n",
      "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\n",
      "be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their\n",
      "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\n",
      "Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\n",
      "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\n",
      "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\n",
      "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\n",
      "drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\n",
      "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\n",
      "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should\n",
      "form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\n",
      "friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\n",
      "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\n",
      "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\n",
      "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\n",
      "not adequate to the risk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\n",
      "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\n",
      "interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\n",
      "Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\n",
      "him capable of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\n",
      "I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\n",
      "hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\n",
      "case?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\n",
      "that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a\n",
      "presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\n",
      "Barnet road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\n",
      "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\n",
      "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\n",
      "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\n",
      "expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\n",
      "marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular\n",
      "friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\n",
      "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\n",
      "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\n",
      "beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,\n",
      "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\n",
      "restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\n",
      "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\n",
      "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n",
      "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\n",
      "brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\n",
      "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\n",
      "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\n",
      "do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\n",
      "such a matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,\n",
      "as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\n",
      "tears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\n",
      "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\n",
      "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\n",
      "nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n",
      "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\n",
      "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\n",
      "flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\n",
      "every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\n",
      "greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\n",
      "naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\n",
      "person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so ill of\n",
      "Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\n",
      "their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\n",
      "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\n",
      "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\n",
      "sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is\n",
      "as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\n",
      "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do, indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you the other day,\n",
      "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\n",
      "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved\n",
      "with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\n",
      "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\n",
      "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\n",
      "what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\n",
      "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\n",
      "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you\n",
      "and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\n",
      "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\n",
      "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\n",
      "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\n",
      "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\n",
      "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\n",
      "apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\n",
      "neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\n",
      "was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\n",
      "opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\n",
      "be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\n",
      "consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\n",
      "enough from my thoughts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\n",
      "suppose, to believe them fond of each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\n",
      "side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\n",
      "that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. When first\n",
      "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\n",
      "were. Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him\n",
      "for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any\n",
      "particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of\n",
      "extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others\n",
      "of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\n",
      "favourites.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\n",
      "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\n",
      "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\n",
      "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find\n",
      "no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\n",
      "the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a\n",
      "comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\n",
      "by long expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\n",
      "on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\n",
      "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\n",
      "faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\n",
      "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,\n",
      "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs\n",
      "from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\n",
      "eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been\n",
      "heard of the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\n",
      "every thing will be well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is my father in town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And have you heard from him often?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\n",
      "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\n",
      "particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\n",
      "again, till he had something of importance to mention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And my mother--How is she? How are you all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\n",
      "shaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\n",
      "all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\n",
      "Heaven! are quite well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you--How are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you\n",
      "must have gone through!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their\n",
      "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\n",
      "engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of\n",
      "the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\n",
      "thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\n",
      "had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\n",
      "found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\n",
      "however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\n",
      "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\n",
      "every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\n",
      "to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\n",
      "conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\n",
      "tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous\n",
      "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;\n",
      "blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the\n",
      "errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point of going to Brighton,\n",
      "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\n",
      "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\n",
      "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\n",
      "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\n",
      "been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\n",
      "the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear\n",
      "child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\n",
      "Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\n",
      "to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\n",
      "in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\n",
      "we shall do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\n",
      "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told\n",
      "her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist\n",
      "Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he, \"though it is right to be\n",
      "prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\n",
      "may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,\n",
      "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\n",
      "lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\n",
      "come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\n",
      "together as to what is to be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\n",
      "could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\n",
      "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\n",
      "marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\n",
      "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,\n",
      "after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\n",
      "fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened\n",
      "out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,\n",
      "such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at\n",
      "heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\n",
      "Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen\n",
      "me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,\n",
      "how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\n",
      "in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\n",
      "her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till\n",
      "dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\n",
      "housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\n",
      "occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\n",
      "oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\n",
      "tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\n",
      "better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\n",
      "most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\n",
      "too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their\n",
      "appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her\n",
      "toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change\n",
      "was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or\n",
      "the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given\n",
      "something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As\n",
      "for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth\n",
      "with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\n",
      "table,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.\n",
      "But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\n",
      "each other, the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n",
      "\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\n",
      "lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false\n",
      "step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less\n",
      "brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded\n",
      "in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\n",
      "make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\n",
      "kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\n",
      "hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\n",
      "opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\n",
      "satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\n",
      "of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\n",
      "Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued\n",
      "the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and every thing about it, which\n",
      "I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel\n",
      "Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement\n",
      "took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\n",
      "especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\n",
      "grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n",
      "_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\n",
      "any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\n",
      "first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\n",
      "their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of\n",
      "their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\n",
      "repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\n",
      "inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\n",
      "doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a\n",
      "little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\n",
      "marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\n",
      "right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how\n",
      "imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\n",
      "triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last\n",
      "letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,\n",
      "of their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I believe not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\n",
      "know his real character?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\n",
      "did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\n",
      "affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in\n",
      "debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\n",
      "this could not have happened!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it would have been better;\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\n",
      "the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present\n",

      "     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n",
      "     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree\n",
      "     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of\n",
      "     yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own\n",

      "     all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he\n",
      "wrote.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And may I ask?\" said Elizabeth, \"but the terms, I suppose, must be\n",
      "complied with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\n",
      "are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\n",
      "your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am\n",
      "ever to pay him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Money! my uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, Sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a\n",
      "temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me\n",
      "before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!\n",
      "it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\n",
      "distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said her father, \"Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a\n",
      "farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so\n",
      "ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\n",
      "repaid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued\n",
      "silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\n",
      "library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\n",
      "were by themselves. \"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be\n",
      "thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\n",
      "and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would\n",
      "not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\n",
      "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\n",
      "thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has\n",
      "children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten\n",
      "thousand pounds?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,\" said\n",
      "Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\n",
      "exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\n",
      "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\n",
      "requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\n",
      "protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as\n",
      "years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n",
      "actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\n",
      "she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\n",
      "first sees my aunt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\" said\n",
      "Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\n",
      "her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\n",
      "thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\n",
      "they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\n",
      "time make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor\n",
      "I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\n",
      "perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\n",
      "therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to\n",
      "make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head,\n",
      "coolly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\"\n",

      "\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\n",

      "Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up\n",
      "stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one\n",
      "communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation\n",
      "for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly\n",
      "contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's\n",
      "being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence\n",
      "added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from\n",
      "delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know\n",
      "that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no\n",
      "fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried: \"This is delightful indeed!--She will\n",
      "be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My\n",
      "good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\n",
      "every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\n",
      "clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\n",
      "them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\n",
      "much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\n",
      "Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\n",
      "Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\n",
      "these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\n",
      "Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\n",
      "measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself\n",
      "to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\n",
      "her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\n",
      "must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have\n",
      "ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\n",
      "In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\n",
      "it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\n",
      "such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you\n",
      "write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\n",
      "afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\n",
      "cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\n",
      "not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her\n",
      "father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,\n",
      "would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite\n",
      "so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\n",
      "good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\n",
      "Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\n",
      "airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any\n",
      "thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\n",
      "heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\n",
      "all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\n",
      "congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\n",
      "refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no\n",
      "worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\n",
      "looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\n",
      "could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\n",
      "had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\n",
      "instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\n",
      "the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\n",
      "him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\n",
      "respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of\n",
      "honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\n",
      "prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\n",
      "her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any\n",
      "one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and\n",
      "he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his\n",
      "assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\n",
      "useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\n",
      "in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\n",
      "and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\n",
      "successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\n",
      "would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\n",
      "late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\n",
      "husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\n",
      "income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\n",
      "the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\n",
      "latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\n",
      "regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\n",
      "could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\n",
      "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\n",
      "expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\n",
      "approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\n",
      "engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\n",
      "that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\n",
      "done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present\n",
      "arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the\n",
      "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\n",
      "allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,\n",
      "through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within\n",
      "that sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\n",
      "another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to\n",
      "have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first\n",
      "transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were\n",
      "over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was\n",
      "soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was\n",
      "quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he\n",
      "was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any\n",
      "message to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\n",
      "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\n",
      "philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of\n",
      "conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\n",
      "happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm\n",
      "house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\n",
      "good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from\n",
      "all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\n",
      "in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her\n",
      "misery was considered certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\n",
      "happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\n",
      "spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\n",
      "triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\n",
      "her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\n",
      "accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\n",
      "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\n",
      "servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\n",
      "proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\n",
      "what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haye-Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\n",
      "great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\n",
      "too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\n",
      "Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the\n",
      "servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, \"Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\n",
      "daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\n",
      "neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage\n",
      "the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\n",
      "soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\n",
      "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\n",
      "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\n",
      "affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\n",
      "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n",
      "resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\n",
      "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\n",
      "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new\n",
      "clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\n",
      "shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they\n",
      "took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\n",
      "the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\n",
      "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\n",
      "termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\n",
      "unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the\n",
      "spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\n",
      "few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\n",
      "but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's\n",
      "frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\n",
      "disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there\n",
      "seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\n",
      "concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\n",
      "objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the\n",
      "nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n",
      "\n",
      "From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\n",
      "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\n",
      "feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\n",
      "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\n",
      "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\n",
      "longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\n",
      "seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\n",
      "she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they\n",
      "should meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\n",
      "proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\n",
      "have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\n",
      "doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\n",
      "there must be a triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in\n",
      "disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\n",
      "temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\n",
      "was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\n",
      "and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,\n",
      "and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\n",
      "have received benefit of greater importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\n",
      "connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\n",
      "precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\n",
      "family.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\n",
      "she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\n",
      "belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\n",
      "were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n",

      "acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\n",
      "promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties\n",
      "that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\n",

      "\n",
      "\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite shocking\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\n",
      "probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\n",
      "them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their\n",
      "arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,\n",
      "who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\n",
      "been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must\n",
      "endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive\n",
      "them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\n",
      "the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\n",
      "anxious, uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\n",
      "she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\n",
      "welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\n",
      "Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an\n",
      "alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\n",
      "so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\n",
      "opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\n",
      "enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\n",
      "shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and\n",
      "fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\n",
      "congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\n",
      "round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\n",
      "observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\n",
      "were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\n",
      "exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\n",
      "claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\n",
      "not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\n",
      "resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence\n",
      "of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of\n",
      "the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\n",
      "of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\n",
      "Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\n",
      "with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\n",
      "replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\n",
      "world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\n",
      "voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for\n",
      "the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\n",
      "it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\n",
      "enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\n",
      "I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\n",
      "thought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\n",
      "expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of\n",
      "which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\n",
      "people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might\n",
      "not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was\n",
      "determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to\n",
      "him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window\n",
      "frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\n",
      "any thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\n",
      "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\n",
      "the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\n",
      "anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to\n",
      "her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\n",
      "lower, because I am a married woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,\n",
      "from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\n",
      "spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\n",
      "their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham,\" by\n",
      "each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her\n",
      "ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\n",
      "room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I\n",
      "am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my\n",
      "good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\n",
      "husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't\n",
      "at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\n",
      "things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\n",
      "shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\n",
      "balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\n",
      "behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\n",
      "winter is over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not\n",
      "particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\n",
      "had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\n",
      "his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and\n",
      "she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and\n",
      "having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\n",
      "all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\n",
      "think, than such as did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to\n",
      "find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\n",
      "present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\n",
      "their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\n",
      "than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\n",
      "for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\n",
      "that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\n",
      "if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\n",
      "of having a companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\n",
      "occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\n",
      "thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\n",
      "the first of September, than any body else in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\n",
      "elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\n",
      "not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\n",
      "curious to hear how it was managed?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said\n",
      "on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\n",
      "married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\n",
      "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\n",
      "o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\n",
      "were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\n",
      "such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put\n",
      "it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my\n",
      "aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if\n",
      "she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten,\n",
      "for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to\n",
      "know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\n",
      "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\n",
      "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\n",
      "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\n",
      "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was\n",
      "rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just\n",
      "as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business\n",
      "to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\n",
      "together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not\n",
      "know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond\n",
      "the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back\n",
      "again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I\n",
      "recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the\n",
      "wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me!\n",
      "I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\n",
      "them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\n",
      "subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\n",
      "ask you no questions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\n",
      "all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\n",
      "power, by running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\n",
      "was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\n",
      "sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\n",
      "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\n",
      "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\n",
      "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\n",
      "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\n",
      "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\n",
      "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n",
      "Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\n",
      "intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be to\n",
      "know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\n",
      "speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\n",
      "a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\n",
      "for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\n",
      "think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\n",
      "ignorance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not that I _shall_ though,\" she added to herself, as she finished the\n",
      "letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\n",
      "manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\n",
      "out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\n",
      "Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\n",
      "it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\n",

      "soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\n",
      "hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\n",
      "interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\n",
      "happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\n",
      "contain a denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"MY DEAR NIECE,\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\n",
      "     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\n",
      "     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\n",
      "     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n",
      "     Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n",
      "     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\n",
      "     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n",
      "     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\n",
      "     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\n",
      "     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n",
      "     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n",
      "     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n",
      "     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n",
      "     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n",
      "     as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that\n",
      "     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that\n",
      "     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia\n",
      "     once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\n",
      "     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting\n",
      "     for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\n",
      "     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\n",
      "     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\n",
      "     to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his\n",
      "     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath\n",
      "     him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character\n",
      "     was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n",
      "     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on\n",
      "     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n",
      "     disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\n",
      "     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n",
      "     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another\n",
      "     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n",
      "     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n",
      "     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n",
      "     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,\n",
      "     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n",
      "     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n",
      "     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n",
      "     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
      "     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n",
      "     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n",
      "     found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\n",
      "     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n",
      "     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n",
      "     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n",
      "     street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n",
      "     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n",
      "     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n",
      "     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n",
      "     offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n",
      "     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n",
      "     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of\n",
      "     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
      "     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n",
      "     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n",
      "     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n",
      "     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n",
      "     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,\n",
      "     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the\n",
      "     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He\n",
      "     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\n",
      "     situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go\n",
      "     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n",
      "     nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\n",
      "     sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,\n",
      "     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation\n",
      "     must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to\n",
      "     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\n",
      "     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.\n",
      "     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\n",
      "     against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,\n",
      "     for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more\n",
      "     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\n",
      "     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was\n",
      "     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\n",
      "     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\n",
      "     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next\n",
      "     morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\n",
      "     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\n",
      "     seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not\n",
      "     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a\n",
      "     gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your\n",
      "     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\n",
      "     had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and\n",
      "     then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon\n",
      "     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor\n",
      "     was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real\n",
      "     defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many\n",
      "     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was\n",
      "     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\n",
      "     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your\n",
      "     uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it\n",
      "     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman\n",
      "     or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced\n",
      "     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\n",
      "     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n",
      "     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\n",
      "     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\n",
      "     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\n",
      "     the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther\n",
      "     than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,\n",
      "     what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,\n",
      "     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\n",
      "     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n",
      "     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n",
      "     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n",
      "     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character\n",
      "     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n",
      "     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n",
      "     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_\n",
      "     reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n",
      "     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\n",
      "     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n",
      "     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n",
      "     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n",
      "     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n",
      "     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n",
      "     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.\n",
      "     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n",
      "     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n",
      "     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n",
      "     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n",
      "     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n",
      "     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\n",
      "     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n",
      "     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\n",
      "     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n",
      "     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and\n",
      "     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,\n",
      "     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\n",
      "     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth\n",
      "     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was\n",
      "     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\n",
      "     wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\n",
      "     on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n",
      "     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n",
      "     enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\n",
      "     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n",
      "     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n",
      "     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n",
      "     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever\n",
      "     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n",
      "     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n",
      "     far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n",
      "     have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\n",

      "heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope\n",
      "shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her\n",
      "vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for\n",
      "her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a\n",
      "sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.\n",
      "Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the\n",
      "connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how\n",
      "much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\n",
      "extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\n",
      "he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\n",
      "it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\n",
      "she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might\n",
      "assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\n",
      "materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\n",
      "they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\n",
      "return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing\n",
      "to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation\n",
      "she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed\n",
      "towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.\n",
      "Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\n",
      "the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him\n",
      "again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\n",

      "misrepresented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\n",

      "\"Very much.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\n",
      "the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\n",
      "repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\n",
      "quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas\n",
      "of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\n",
      "circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\n",
      "left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\n",
      "first, you may remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so\n",
      "palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\n",
      "declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\n",
      "had been compromised accordingly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\n",
      "what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\n",
      "to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,\n",
      "she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\n",
      "never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\n",
      "by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\n",
      "had said enough to keep him quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\n",
      "forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\n",
      "entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\n",
      "continue at least a twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\n",

      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He\n",
      "smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\n",
      "the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\n",
      "all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\n",
      "himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with\n",
      "one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said\n",
      "Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\n",
      "single.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\n",
      "but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If\n",
      "that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was\n",
      "shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by\n",
      "an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The\n",
      "housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the\n",
      "arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot\n",
      "there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She\n",
      "looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\n",
      "Philips first brought her the news.) \"Well, so much the better. Not that\n",
      "I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure\n",
      "_I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to\n",
      "come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\n",
      "But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\n",
      "mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in\n",
      "Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\n",
      "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\n",
      "comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\n",
      "going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\n",
      "Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be\n",
      "killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing\n",
      "colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\n",
      "Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\n",
      "report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\n",
      "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt\n",
      "that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not\n",
      "affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he\n",
      "comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid\n",
      "of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\n",
      "Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no\n",
      "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\n",
      "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\n",
      "there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\n",
      "without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot come\n",
      "to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\n",
      "speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\n",
      "feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\n",
      "perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\n",
      "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\n",
      "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you\n",
      "will wait on him of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I\n",
      "went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\n",
      "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\n",
      "would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\n",
      "Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society, let\n",
      "him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\n",
      "running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not\n",
      "wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine\n",
      "here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.\n",
      "That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at\n",
      "table for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\n",
      "husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\n",
      "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_\n",
      "did. As the day of his arrival drew near,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\n",
      "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\n",
      "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\n",
      "but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she\n",
      "says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but\n",
      "it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual\n",
      "satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because\n",
      "you have always so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\n",
      "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\n",
      "and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted\n",
      "the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\n",
      "hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\n",
      "arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,\n",
      "enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\n",
      "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\n",

      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "him before. Mr. what's his name. That tall, proud man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of\n",

      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\n",
      "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\n",
      "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\n",
      "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\n",
      "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n",
      "mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\n",
      "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\n",
      "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\n",
      "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\n",
      "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and\n",
      "whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\n",
      "information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted\n",
      "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n",
      "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\n",
      "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\n",
      "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\n",
      "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\n",
      "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\n",
      "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\n",
      "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and\n",
      "wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\n",
      "enough for expectation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\n",
      "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\n",
      "sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\n",
      "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\n",
      "gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\n",
      "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n",
      "symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\n",
      "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\n",
      "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and\n",
      "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\n",
      "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\n",
      "presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\n",
      "not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\n",
      "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,\n",
      "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\n",
      "her curtsey and address to his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\n",
      "preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\n",
      "hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\n",
      "applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\n",
      "which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.\n",
      "He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;\n",
      "but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her\n",
      "friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,\n",
      "without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\n",
      "to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she\n",
      "as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no\n",
      "object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please\n",
      "than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,\n",
      "and angry with herself for being so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to\n",
      "him she had hardly courage to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He readily agreed to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\n",
      "you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\n",
      "it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\n",
      "own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\n",
      "seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;\n",
      "though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\n",
      "George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\n",
      "syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.\n",
      "It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\n",
      "make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\n",
      "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\n",
      "not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\n",
      "continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\n",
      "hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\n",
      "Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\n",
      "stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you\n",
      "have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\n",
      "regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\n",
      "many as he deserves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\n",
      "of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\n",
      "however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\n",
      "done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in\n",
      "the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\n",
      "\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.\n",
      "Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\n",
      "will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\n",
      "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\n",
      "flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\n",
      "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\n",
      "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for\n",
      "moments of such painful confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be\n",
      "in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,\n",
      "that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\n",
      "one or the other again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\n",
      "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\n",
      "how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\n",
      "former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\n",
      "but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\n",
      "found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as\n",
      "unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\n",
      "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n",
      "that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\n",
      "that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\n",
      "intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\n",
      "Longbourn in a few days time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when\n",
      "you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\n",
      "us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\n",
      "you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\n",
      "your engagement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\n",
      "his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\n",
      "there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\n",
      "not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a\n",
      "man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and\n",
      "pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\n",
      "or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\n",
      "must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\" said she,\n",
      "\"did he come at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\n",
      "he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\n",
      "he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will\n",
      "think no more about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\n",
      "of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her\n",
      "better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\n",
      "easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\n",
      "his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\n",
      "seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent\n",
      "acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly. \"Oh, Jane,\n",

      "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\n",
      "the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\n",
      "humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\n",
      "revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,\n",
      "who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\n",
      "sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\n",
      "dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\n",
      "the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\n",
      "her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\n",
      "invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\n",
      "hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\n",
      "decided. He placed himself by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\n",
      "bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\n",
      "Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\n",
      "likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\n",
      "alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an\n",
      "admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\n",
      "Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\n",
      "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\n",
      "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n",
      "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\n",
      "no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table\n",
      "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\n",
      "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\n",
      "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\n",
      "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\n",
      "cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\n",
      "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\n",
      "and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell\n",
      "him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\n",
      "the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\n",
      "bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\n",
      "without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than\n",
      "the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\n",
      "uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\n",
      "gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her\n",
      "uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all\n",
      "her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\n",
      "ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\n",
      "answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\n",
      "where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\n",
      "in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,\n",
      "which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\n",
      "the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\n",
      "do we?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\n",
      "her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience\n",
      "enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself\n",
      "for being so silly!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\n",
      "expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\n",
      "protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\n",
      "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\n",
      "himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\n",

      "\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\n",
      "these three weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\n",
      "with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\n",
      "some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\n",
      "to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\n",
      "all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\n",
      "all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\n",
      "mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\n",
      "with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\n",
      "They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\n",
      "nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\n",
      "of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\n",
      "supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\n",
      "others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\n",
      "say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\n",
      "I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\n",
      "venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\n",
      "a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\n",
      "Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\n",
      "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\n",
      "cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\n",
      "beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\n",
      "what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\n",
      "at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\n",
      "a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\n",
      "and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\n",
      "Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\n",
      "last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\n",
      "humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\n",
      "not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\n",
      "party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\n",
      "may often meet again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\n",
      "assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\n",
      "agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\n",
      "perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any\n",
      "design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\n",
      "greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\n",
      "pleasing than any other man.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "He should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would\n",
      "give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\n",
      "accepted with alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\n",
      "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\n",
      "gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\n",
      "come.--He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\n",
      "Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\n",
      "Lizzy's hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\n",
      "forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\n",
      "where is your sash my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\n",
      "without one of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the\n",
      "evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\n",
      "custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\n",
      "five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\n",
      "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\n",
      "impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\n",
      "Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do\n",
      "you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still five\n",
      "minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\n",
      "suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\n",
      "Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at\n",
      "such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.\n",
      "In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother as\n",
      "soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\n",
      "my dressing-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\n",
      "quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\n",
      "into the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\n",
      "thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\n",
      "ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\n",
      "evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\n",
      "mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\n",
      "of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\n",
      "away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\n",
      "between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\n",
      "the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\n",
      "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\n",
      "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\n",
      "concurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\n",
      "morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\n",
      "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\n",
      "or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him\n",
      "into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the\n",
      "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\n",
      "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\n",
      "every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\n",
      "to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\n",
      "for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n",
      "wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\n",
      "saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\n",
      "had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\n",
      "sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\n",
      "earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\n",
      "both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would\n",
      "have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she\n",
      "thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\n",
      "Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\n",
      "well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\n",
      "words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\n",
      "pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\n",
      "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\n",
      "why is not every body as happy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\n",
      "delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\n",
      "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\n",
      "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\n",
      "said, for the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\n",
      "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\n",
      "from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\n",
      "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\n",
      "family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\n",
      "card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\n",
      "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\n",
      "previous months of suspense and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\n",
      "circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the\n",
      "happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\n",
      "father had been short and to the purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and\n",
      "affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\n",
      "delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\n",
      "great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen\n",
      "to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\n",
      "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\n",
      "expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for\n",
      "basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\n",
      "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\n",
      "Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\n",
      "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\n",
      "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\n",
      "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\n",
      "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\n",
      "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed\n",
      "how really happy he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\n",
      "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\n",
      "turned to his daughter and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\n",
      "goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\n",
      "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\n",
      "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\n",
      "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\n",
      "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\n",
      "always exceed your income.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be\n",
      "unpardonable in _me_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\n",
      "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely\n",
      "more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\n",
      "happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\n",
      "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\n",
      "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\n",
      "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\n",
      "that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\n",
      "ever was seen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\n",
      "favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\n",
      "sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\n",
      "which she might in future be able to dispense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\n",
      "begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\n",
      "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\n",
      "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\n",
      "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\n",
      "himself obliged to accept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\n",
      "while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;\n",
      "but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those\n",
      "hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,\n",
      "he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\n",
      "her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\n",
      "relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me, that\n",
      "he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not\n",
      "believed it possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\n",
      "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\n",
      "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\n",
      "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\n",
      "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\n",
      "can never be what we once were to each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\n",
      "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\n",
      "the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\n",
      "he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\n",
      "indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\n",
      "modesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\n",
      "the little value he put on his own good qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference\n",
      "of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\n",
      "heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\n",
      "her against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\n",
      "Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\n",
      "above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but\n",
      "such another man for you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\n",
      "you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\n",
      "happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\n",
      "good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\n",
      "secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\n",
      "_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\n",
      "neighbours in Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\n",
      "world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\n",
      "they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\n",
      "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\n",
      "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\n",
      "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\n",
      "lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\n",
      "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\n",
      "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\n",
      "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\n",
      "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\n",
      "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n",
      "shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\n",
      "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\n",
      "open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\n",
      "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\n",
      "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\n",
      "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\n",
      "other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the\n",
      "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\n",
      "name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\n",
      "introduction had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\n",
      "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\n",
      "for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.\n",
      "\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married,\n",
      "and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,\n",
      "who I believe will soon become a part of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\n",
      "assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\n",
      "summer; the windows are full west.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\n",
      "added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Collins well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\n",
      "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\n",
      "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\n",
      "refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\n",
      "declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\n",
      "on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\n",
      "will favour me with your company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about the\n",
      "different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\n",
      "attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,\n",
      "Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\n",
      "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\n",
      "looking rooms, walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\n",
      "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\n",
      "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\n",
      "conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and\n",
      "disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\n",
      "her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\n",
      "manner:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\n",
      "journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\n",
      "come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\n",
      "for the honour of seeing you here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\n",
      "know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\n",
      "choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\n",
      "celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\n",
      "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\n",
      "alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\n",
      "sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n",
      "_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\n",
      "afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n",
      "_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him\n",
      "so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\n",
      "setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\n",
      "with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\n",
      "so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth,\n",

      "the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\n",
      "be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\n",
      "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n",
      "the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\n",
      "tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\n",
      "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\n",
      "earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\n",
      "other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\n",
      "kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\n",
      "Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the\n",
      "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\n",
      "honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\n",
      "another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\n",

      "side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\n",
      "honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both\n",
      "sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\n",
      "every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The\n",
      "upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or\n",
      "fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\n",

      "\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am not.\"\n",

      "\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\n",
      "reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\n",
      "will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the\n",
      "assurance I require.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\n",
      "anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\n",
      "your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make\n",
      "_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\n",
      "me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it\n",
      "on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\n",
      "which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as\n",
      "frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\n",
      "character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\n",
      "How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\n",
      "I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\n",
      "mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the\n",
      "subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\n",
      "objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no\n",
      "stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\n",
      "elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a\n",
      "patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\n",
      "_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of\n",
      "his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what\n",
      "are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully answered.\n",
      "\"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\n",
      "the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\n",
      "back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\n",
      "Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,\n",
      "must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\n",
      "which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\n",
      "reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\n",
      "claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\n",
      "the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any\n",
      "possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,\n",
      "would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\n",
      "resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n",
      "_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\n",
      "concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\n",
      "the scorn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\n",
      "shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\n",
      "ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\n",
      "reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\n",
      "the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\n",
      "mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\n",
      "ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\n",
      "heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\n",
      "impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\n",
      "Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\n",
      "civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\n",
      "She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through\n",
      "Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\n",
      "nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\n",
      "acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw\n",
      "Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\n",
      "hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it\n",
      "appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\n",
      "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\n",
      "Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of\n",
      "their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\n",
      "till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\n",
      "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\n",
      "expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\n",
      "the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\n",
      "sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\n",
      "Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\n",
      "Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only\n",
      "set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked\n",
      "forward to as possible, at some future time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\n",
      "feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\n",
      "in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\n",
      "prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\n",
      "an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\n",
      "representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\n",
      "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\n",
      "aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\n",
      "that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\n",
      "was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\n",
      "whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\n",
      "address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\n",
      "probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\n",
      "and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\n",
      "seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\n",
      "settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\n",
      "unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\n",
      "Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\n",
      "Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to\n",
      "his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to\n",
      "understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of\n",
      "his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\n",
      "have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\n",
      "at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\n",
      "been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\n",
      "kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and\n",
      "Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\n",
      "father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\n",
      "her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\n",
      "connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\n",
      "be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\n",
      "consequent explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\n",
      "then said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\n",
      "exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\n",
      "contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\n",
      "of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\n",
      "conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\n",
      "and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\n",
      "himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\n",
      "herself; when her father continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\n",
      "as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\n",
      "name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\n",
      "congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\n",
      "which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping\n",
      "Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\n",
      "on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. \"Having thus\n",
      "offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\n",
      "this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:\n",
      "of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\n",
      "Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\n",
      "her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,\n",
      "may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious\n",
      "personages in this land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\" \"This young\n",
      "gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\n",
      "mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\n",
      "patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\n",
      "Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate\n",
      "closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\n",
      "inclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine\n",
      "that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\n",
      "a friendly eye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\n",
      "surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\n",
      "the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\n",
      "effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\n",
      "woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\n",
      "his life! It is admirable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\n",
      "one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\n",
      "little agreeable to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you not diverted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\n",
      "night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\n",
      "felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\n",
      "family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\n",
      "consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\n",
      "to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\n",
      "her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\n",
      "hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\" \"Mr.\n",
      "Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\n",
      "business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\n",
      "living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally\n",
      "known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\n",
      "from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\n",
      "couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\n",
      "encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\n",
      "very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\n",
      "a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names\n",
      "to be mentioned in your hearing.\" \"_That_ is his notion of christian\n",
      "forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\n",
      "situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\n",
      "look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I\n",
      "hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\n",
      "live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\n",
      "turn?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\n",
      "strange!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\n",
      "it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\n",
      "pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\n",
      "writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\n",
      "consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\n",
      "him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\n",
      "hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\n",

      "Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\n",
      "Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\n",
      "with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\n",

      "their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\n",
      "habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\n",
      "set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\n",
      "outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,\n",
      "were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\n",
      "too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\n",

      "high, she immediately said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\n",
      "relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's. I\n",
      "can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\n",
      "sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\n",
      "acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\n",
      "of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\n",
      "and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\n",
      "mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.\n",
      "Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\n",
      "me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\n",
      "not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\n",
      "in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\n",
      "you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\n",
      "sake of discovering them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\n",

      "inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\n",

      "Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\n",

      "very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone\n",
      "so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\n",
      "her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The\n",
      "happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\n",
      "felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\n",
      "warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\n",
      "been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\n",
      "expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\n",
      "but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\n",
      "feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\n",
      "affection every moment more valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\n",
      "be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\n",
      "soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\n",
      "to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\n",
      "London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\n",
      "substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\n",
      "every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\n",
      "peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\n",
      "such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\n",
      "her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\n",
      "ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\n",
      "to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,\n",
      "had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\n",

      "\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of\n",
      "my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\n",
      "abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\n",
      "your relations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\n",
      "accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\n",
      "to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\n",
      "evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\n",

      "in civility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\n",
      "then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\n",
      "it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\n",
      "reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\n",
      "more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you\n",
      "can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\n",
      "all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\n",

      "Darcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it _soon_ make you\n",

      "contents?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\n",
      "necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\n",
      "especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\n",
      "power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\n",
      "justly make you hate me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\n",
      "preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\n",
      "opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\n",
      "changed as that implies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\n",
      "calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\n",
      "dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\n",
      "adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\n",
      "of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\n",
      "widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\n",
      "circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\n",
      "of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\n",
      "pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\n",
      "retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\n",
      "arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of\n",
      "ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\n",
      "intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\n",
      "selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\n",
      "child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\n",
      "temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\n",
      "and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)\n",
      "I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father\n",
      "particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\n",
      "almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\n",
      "my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n",
      "_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\n",
      "my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might\n",
      "still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\n",
      "owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\n",
      "advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\n",
      "doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.\n",
      "I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.\n",

      "\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\n",
      "a proper direction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at\n",

      "\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\n",

      "confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My object _then_,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every civility\n",
      "in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\n",
      "to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\n",
      "see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\n",

      "disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\n",
      "the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\n",
      "following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed\n",
      "before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\n",
      "there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\n",
      "comprehend.\n",

      "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which\n",

      "it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he \"I made a confession\n",
      "to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of\n",
      "all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,\n",
      "absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the\n",
      "slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\n",
      "mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\n",

      "\n",
      "\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\n",
      "which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\n",
      "prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\n",
      "his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\n",
      "one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\n",
      "allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\n",
      "last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\n",
      "angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\n",

      "Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\n",
      "friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\n",
      "herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it\n",
      "was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,\n",
      "which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\n",

      "from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\n",
      "reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\n",

      "there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\n",

      "to do?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\n",
      "coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or\n",
      "other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\n",
      "Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\n",
      "was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\n",
      "epithet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\n",
      "shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\n",
      "and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes\n",
      "hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk\n",
      "to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\n",
      "never seen the view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am\n",
      "sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\n",
      "curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\n",
      "consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\n",
      "saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\n",
      "disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is\n",
      "all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\n",
      "him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to\n",
      "inconvenience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be\n",
      "asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\n",
      "application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother\n",
      "would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\n",
      "would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\n",
      "were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\n",
      "was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\n",
      "her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\n",
      "first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\n",
      "disapprobation.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\n",
      "Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\n",
      "extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\n",
      "be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,\n",
      "his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\n",
      "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\n",
      "reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\n",
      "looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\n",
      "he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\n",
      "pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\n",
      "wants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n",
      "\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\n",
      "accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\n",
      "reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\n",
      "explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\n",
      "but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of\n",
      "her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\n",
      "sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\n",
      "But will they make you happy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\n",
      "indifference?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\n",
      "this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\n",
      "Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\n",
      "know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\n",
      "such terms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\n",
      "of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he\n",
      "condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\n",
      "having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\n",
      "disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\n",
      "respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\n",
      "up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\n",
      "greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\n",
      "discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n",
      "_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\n",
      "about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\n",
      "and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\n",
      "object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\n",
      "estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\n",
      "his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\n",
      "months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she\n",
      "did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\n",
      "say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\n",
      "you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\n",
      "had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\n",
      "made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\n",
      "his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\n",
      "and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\n",
      "paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\n",
      "way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\n",
      "his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\n",
      "Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\n",
      "at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\n",
      "for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\n",
      "half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\n",
      "the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for\n",
      "gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any\n",
      "thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\n",
      "would come in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\n",
      "and made the important communication. Its effect was most\n",
      "extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and\n",
      "unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that\n",
      "she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to\n",
      "credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\n",
      "shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to\n",
      "fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\n",
      "have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\n",
      "and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\n",
      "you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\n",
      "pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\n",
      "dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\n",
      "hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\n",

      "Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\n",
      "Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\n",
      "soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\n",
      "her mother followed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten\n",

      "consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\n",
      "passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\n",
      "in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\n",
      "to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\n",

      "produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\n",
      "well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was\n",
      "lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in\n",

      "became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\n",
      "ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's\n",
      "society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\n",

      "drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite\n",
      "unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\n",
      "she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\n",

      "and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\n",
      "thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\n",

      "from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\n",
      "if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\n",
      "     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n",
      "     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n",
      "     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n",
      "     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n",
      "     upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four\n",
      "     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\n",
      "     if you had rather not.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yours, &c.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\n",
      "her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.\n",
      "Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\n",
      "of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\n",
      "frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\n",
      "income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\n",
      "their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\n",
      "their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\n",
      "herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance\n",
      "towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\n",
      "restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\n",
      "extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\n",
      "situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\n",
      "her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in\n",
      "spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\n",
      "reputation which her marriage had given her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\n",
      "Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was\n",
      "occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\n",
      "in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\n",
      "staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he\n",
      "proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she\n",
      "thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\n",
      "dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\n",
      "attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\n",
      "to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters\n",
      "was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\n",
      "other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\n",
      "in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\n",
      "astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of\n",
      "talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\n",
      "which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\n",
      "pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\n",
      "her way. By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a\n",

      "always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\n",
      "\n",

      "and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\n",
      "her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\n",
      "language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\n",
      "all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\n",
      "he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\n",
      "and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\n",
      "resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\n",
      "to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\n",
      "them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\n",
