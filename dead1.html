EXPLANATORY

IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the Missouri negro
dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the
ordinary &quot;Pike County&quot; dialect; and four modified varieties of this
last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by
guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and
support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.

I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers
would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and
not succeeding.

THE AUTHOR.




HUCKLEBERRY FINN

Scene:  The Mississippi Valley Time:  Forty to fifty years ago




CHAPTER I.

YOU don&#39;t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain&#39;t no matter.  That book was made
by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom&#39;s Aunt Polly, she
is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.

Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six
thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out
at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn&#39;t stand
it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.

The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn&#39;t do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing
commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
to time. When you got to the table you couldn&#39;t go right to eating, but
you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little
over the victuals, though there warn&#39;t really anything the matter with
them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a
barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the
juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.

After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and
by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so
then I didn&#39;t care no more about him, because I don&#39;t take no stock in
dead people.

Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she
wouldn&#39;t.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn&#39;t clean, and I must
try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They
get down on a thing when they don&#39;t know nothing about it.  Here she was
a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,
being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that
was all right, because she done it herself.

Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
the widow made her ease up.  I couldn&#39;t stood it much longer.  Then for
an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,
&quot;Don&#39;t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t scrunch up
like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;&quot; and pretty soon she would
say, &quot;Don&#39;t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don&#39;t you try to
behave?&quot;  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
I was there. She got mad then, but I didn&#39;t mean no harm.  All I wanted
was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn&#39;t particular.
 She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn&#39;t say it for
the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
 Well, I couldn&#39;t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouldn&#39;t try for it.  But I never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldn&#39;t do no good.

Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn&#39;t think
much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad
about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
 By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn&#39;t no use.  I felt
so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the
leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying
to whisper something to me, and I couldn&#39;t make out what it was, and so
it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard
that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about
something that&#39;s on its mind and can&#39;t make itself understood, and so
can&#39;t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night
grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
was all shriveled up.  I didn&#39;t need anybody to tell me that that was
an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared
and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied
up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But
I hadn&#39;t no confidence.  You do that when you&#39;ve lost a horseshoe that
you&#39;ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn&#39;t ever
heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you&#39;d killed
a spider.

I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn&#39;t
know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town
go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I
could just barely hear a &quot;me-yow! me-yow!&quot; down there.  That was good!
 Says I, &quot;me-yow! me-yow!&quot; as soft as I could, and then I put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.




CHAPTER II.

WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widow&#39;s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn&#39;t scrape our
heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made
a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson&#39;s big nigger,
named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched
his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:

&quot;Who dah?&quot;

He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was
minutes and minutes that there warn&#39;t a sound, and we all there so close
together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
dasn&#39;t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I&#39;d die if I couldn&#39;t scratch.
 Well, I&#39;ve noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with
the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain&#39;t
sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won&#39;t do for you to scratch, why
you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
says:

&quot;Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn&#39; hear sumf&#39;n.
Well, I know what I&#39;s gwyne to do:  I&#39;s gwyne to set down here and
listen tell I hears it agin.&quot;

So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into
my eyes.  But I dasn&#39;t scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.
Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn&#39;t know how I was going to set
still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but
it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different
places now.  I reckoned I couldn&#39;t stand it more&#39;n a minute longer,
but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun
to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon
comfortable again.

Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they&#39;d find out I
warn&#39;t in. Then Tom said he hadn&#39;t got candles enough, and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn&#39;t want him to try.  I said Jim
might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do
Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play
something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was
so still and lonesome.

As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim&#39;s hat off of his head and hung it
on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn&#39;t wake.
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told
it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back
was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he
got so he wouldn&#39;t hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come
miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths
open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is
always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,
Jim would happen in and say, &quot;Hm!  What you know &#39;bout witches?&quot; and
that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept
that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could
cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by
saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.
 Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they
had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn&#39;t touch
it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for
a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil
and been rode by witches.

Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and
Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
 So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,
to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.

We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldn&#39;t a noticed that there was a hole.  We
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:

&quot;Now, we&#39;ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer&#39;s Gang.
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
in blood.&quot;

Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
his family must do it, and he mustn&#39;t eat and he mustn&#39;t sleep till he
had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
of the band. And nobody that didn&#39;t belong to the band could use that
mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the
ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
and be forgot forever.

Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got
it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
it.

Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
it in. Then Ben Rogers says:

&quot;Here&#39;s Huck Finn, he hain&#39;t got no family; what you going to do &#39;bout
him?&quot;

&quot;Well, hain&#39;t he got a father?&quot; says Tom Sawyer.

&quot;Yes, he&#39;s got a father, but you can&#39;t never find him these days.  He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain&#39;t been seen
in these parts for a year or more.&quot;

They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldn&#39;t be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of
anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready
to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:

&quot;Oh, she&#39;ll do.  That&#39;s all right.  Huck can come in.&quot;

Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and I made my mark on the paper.

&quot;Now,&quot; says Ben Rogers, &quot;what&#39;s the line of business of this Gang?&quot;

&quot;Nothing only robbery and murder,&quot; Tom said.

&quot;But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--&quot;

&quot;Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain&#39;t robbery; it&#39;s burglary,&quot;
says Tom Sawyer.  &quot;We ain&#39;t burglars.  That ain&#39;t no sort of style.  We
are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.&quot;

&quot;Must we always kill the people?&quot;

&quot;Oh, certainly.  It&#39;s best.  Some authorities think different, but
mostly it&#39;s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to
the cave here, and keep them till they&#39;re ransomed.&quot;

&quot;Ransomed?  What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  But that&#39;s what they do.  I&#39;ve seen it in books; and so
of course that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got to do.&quot;

&quot;But how can we do it if we don&#39;t know what it is?&quot;

&quot;Why, blame it all, we&#39;ve _got_ to do it.  Don&#39;t I tell you it&#39;s in the
books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what&#39;s in the books,
and get things all muddled up?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don&#39;t know how to do it
to them?--that&#39;s the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it
is?&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know.  But per&#39;aps if we keep them till they&#39;re ransomed,
it means that we keep them till they&#39;re dead.&quot;

&quot;Now, that&#39;s something _like_.  That&#39;ll answer.  Why couldn&#39;t you said
that before?  We&#39;ll keep them till they&#39;re ransomed to death; and a
bothersome lot they&#39;ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying
to get loose.&quot;

&quot;How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there&#39;s a guard
over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?&quot;

&quot;A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody&#39;s got to set up all night
and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that&#39;s
foolishness. Why can&#39;t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as
they get here?&quot;

&quot;Because it ain&#39;t in the books so--that&#39;s why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you
want to do things regular, or don&#39;t you?--that&#39;s the idea.  Don&#39;t you
reckon that the people that made the books knows what&#39;s the correct
thing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn &#39;em anything?  Not by a good
deal. No, sir, we&#39;ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.&quot;

&quot;All right.  I don&#39;t mind; but I say it&#39;s a fool way, anyhow.  Say, do
we kill the women, too?&quot;

&quot;Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn&#39;t let on.  Kill
the women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You
fetch them to the cave, and you&#39;re always as polite as pie to them;
and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any
more.&quot;

&quot;Well, if that&#39;s the way I&#39;m agreed, but I don&#39;t take no stock in it.
Mighty soon we&#39;ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
waiting to be ransomed, that there won&#39;t be no place for the robbers.
But go ahead, I ain&#39;t got nothing to say.&quot;

Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn&#39;t
want to be a robber any more.

So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  But
Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.

Ben Rogers said he couldn&#39;t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.

I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
dog-tired.




CHAPTER III.

WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes; but the widow she didn&#39;t scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
and prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and
whatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn&#39;t so.  I tried it.
Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn&#39;t any good to me without
hooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn&#39;t make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to
try for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and I
couldn&#39;t make it out no way.

I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
 I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don&#39;t
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can&#39;t the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can&#39;t Miss Watson fat up?
No, says I to my self, there ain&#39;t nothing in it.  I went and told the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
it was &quot;spiritual gifts.&quot;  This was too many for me, but she told me
what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for
other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the
woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn&#39;t see no
advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned
I wouldn&#39;t worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
a body&#39;s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
and knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two
Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widow&#39;s Providence, but if Miss Watson&#39;s got him there warn&#39;t no help
for him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong
to the widow&#39;s if he wanted me, though I couldn&#39;t make out how he was
a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.

Pap he hadn&#39;t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
for me; I didn&#39;t want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this time
he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
like pap; but they couldn&#39;t make nothing out of the face, because it had
been in the water so long it warn&#39;t much like a face at all.  They said
he was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him
on the bank.  But I warn&#39;t comfortable long, because I happened to think
of something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don&#39;t float on
his back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn&#39;t pap, but
a woman dressed up in a man&#39;s clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.
 I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he
wouldn&#39;t.

We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All
the boys did.  We hadn&#39;t robbed nobody, hadn&#39;t killed any people, but
only just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs &quot;ingots,&quot;
and he called the turnips and stuff &quot;julery,&quot; and we would go to the
cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
and marked.  But I couldn&#39;t see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a
boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
(which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he
had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand &quot;sumter&quot;
mules, all loaded down with di&#39;monds, and they didn&#39;t have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called
it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick up
our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a
turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
till you rotted, and then they warn&#39;t worth a mouthful of ashes more
than what they was before.  I didn&#39;t believe we could lick such a crowd
of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,
so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got
the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn&#39;t
no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn&#39;t no camels nor no elephants.
 It warn&#39;t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
at that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got
a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

 I didn&#39;t see no di&#39;monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was
loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
and elephants and things.  I said, why couldn&#39;t we see them, then?  He
said if I warn&#39;t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
would know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He
said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
 I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
magicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.

&quot;Why,&quot; said he, &quot;a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they
would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  They
are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;s&#39;pose we got some genies to help _us_--can&#39;t we lick
the other crowd then?&quot;

&quot;How you going to get them?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  How do _they_ get them?&quot;

&quot;Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the
smoke a-rolling, and everything they&#39;re told to do they up and do it.
 They don&#39;t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and
belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any
other man.&quot;

&quot;Who makes them tear around so?&quot;

&quot;Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubs
the lamp or the ring, and they&#39;ve got to do whatever he says.  If he
tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di&#39;monds, and fill
it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor&#39;s
daughter from China for you to marry, they&#39;ve got to do it--and they&#39;ve
got to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they&#39;ve got
to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
understand.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping
the palace themselves &#39;stead of fooling them away like that.  And what&#39;s
more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.&quot;

&quot;How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you&#39;d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,
whether you wanted to or not.&quot;

&quot;What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;
I _would_ come; but I lay I&#39;d make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country.&quot;

&quot;Shucks, it ain&#39;t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don&#39;t seem to
know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.&quot;

I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I
would see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and an
iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat
like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn&#39;t
no use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuff
was only just one of Tom Sawyer&#39;s lies.  I reckoned he believed in the
A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all
the marks of a Sunday-school.




CHAPTER IV.

WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter
now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirty-five, and I don&#39;t reckon I could ever get any
further than that if I was to live forever.  I don&#39;t take no stock in
mathematics, anyway.

At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
day done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school the
easier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow&#39;s ways,
too, and they warn&#39;t so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in
a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I
used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a
rest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but
sure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn&#39;t ashamed of me.

One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.
 I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left
shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
and crossed me off. She says, &quot;Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what
a mess you are always making!&quot;  The widow put in a good word for me, but
that warn&#39;t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
 I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
 There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn&#39;t one
of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along
low-spirited and on the watch-out.

I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the
ground, and I seen somebody&#39;s tracks.  They had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden
fence.  It was funny they hadn&#39;t come in, after standing around so.  I
couldn&#39;t make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to
follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn&#39;t
notice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left
boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.

I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over my
shoulder every now and then, but I didn&#39;t see nobody.  I was at Judge
Thatcher&#39;s as quick as I could get there.  He said:

&quot;Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for your
interest?&quot;

&quot;No, sir,&quot; I says; &quot;is there some for me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty
dollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest it
along with your six thousand, because if you take it you&#39;ll spend it.&quot;

&quot;No, sir,&quot; I says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to spend it.  I don&#39;t want it at
all--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to give
it to you--the six thousand and all.&quot;

He looked surprised.  He couldn&#39;t seem to make it out.  He says:

&quot;Why, what can you mean, my boy?&quot;

I says, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask me no questions about it, please.  You&#39;ll take
it--won&#39;t you?&quot;

He says:

&quot;Well, I&#39;m puzzled.  Is something the matter?&quot;

&quot;Please take it,&quot; says I, &quot;and don&#39;t ask me nothing--then I won&#39;t have to
tell no lies.&quot;

He studied a while, and then he says:

&quot;Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
give it.  That&#39;s the correct idea.&quot;

Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:

&quot;There; you see it says &#39;for a consideration.&#39;  That means I have bought
it of you and paid you for it.  Here&#39;s a dollar for you.  Now you sign
it.&quot;

So I signed it, and left.

Miss Watson&#39;s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
magic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
everything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
again, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,
what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his
hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
it on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
 Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
 Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.
 But it warn&#39;t no use; he said it wouldn&#39;t talk. He said sometimes it
wouldn&#39;t talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit
quarter that warn&#39;t no good because the brass showed through the silver
a little, and it wouldn&#39;t pass nohow, even if the brass didn&#39;t show,
because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it
every time.  (I reckoned I wouldn&#39;t say nothing about the dollar I got
from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
would take it, because maybe it wouldn&#39;t know the difference.  Jim smelt
it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball
would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato
and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next
morning you couldn&#39;t see no brass, and it wouldn&#39;t feel greasy no more,
and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
 Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.

Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened
again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said it
would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So the
hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:

&quot;Yo&#39; ole father doan&#39; know yit what he&#39;s a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes he
spec he&#39;ll go &#39;way, en den agin he spec he&#39;ll stay.  De bes&#39; way is to
res&#39; easy en let de ole man take his own way.  Dey&#39;s two angels hoverin&#39;
roun&#39; &#39;bout him.  One uv &#39;em is white en shiny, en t&#39;other one is black.
De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail
in en bust it all up.  A body can&#39;t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch
him at de las&#39;.  But you is all right.  You gwyne to have considable
trouble in yo&#39; life, en considable joy.  Sometimes you gwyne to git
hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you&#39;s gwyne
to git well agin.  Dey&#39;s two gals flyin&#39; &#39;bout you in yo&#39; life.  One
uv &#39;em&#39;s light en t&#39;other one is dark. One is rich en t&#39;other is po&#39;.
 You&#39;s gwyne to marry de po&#39; one fust en de rich one by en by.  You
wants to keep &#39;way fum de water as much as you kin, en don&#39;t run no
resk, &#39;kase it&#39;s down in de bills dat you&#39;s gwyne to git hung.&quot;

When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his
own self!




CHAPTER V.

I had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I used
to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned I
was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after
the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being
so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn&#39;t scared of him worth
bothring about.

He was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled and
greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through
like he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
mixed-up whiskers.  There warn&#39;t no color in his face, where his face
showed; it was white; not like another man&#39;s white, but a white to make
a body sick, a white to make a body&#39;s flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a
fish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He had
one ankle resting on t&#39;other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and
two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat
was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like
a lid.

I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
tilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window was
up; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  By
and by he says:

&quot;Starchy clothes--very.  You think you&#39;re a good deal of a big-bug,
_don&#39;t_ you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe I am, maybe I ain&#39;t,&quot; I says.

&quot;Don&#39;t you give me none o&#39; your lip,&quot; says he.  &quot;You&#39;ve put on
considerable many frills since I been away.  I&#39;ll take you down a peg
before I get done with you.  You&#39;re educated, too, they say--can read and
write.  You think you&#39;re better&#39;n your father, now, don&#39;t you, because
he can&#39;t?  _I&#39;ll_ take it out of you.  Who told you you might meddle
with such hifalut&#39;n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?&quot;

&quot;The widow.  She told me.&quot;

&quot;The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel
about a thing that ain&#39;t none of her business?&quot;

&quot;Nobody never told her.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here--you drop that
school, you hear?  I&#39;ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs
over his own father and let on to be better&#39;n what _he_ is.  You lemme
catch you fooling around that school again, you hear?  Your mother
couldn&#39;t read, and she couldn&#39;t write, nuther, before she died.  None
of the family couldn&#39;t before _they_ died.  I can&#39;t; and here you&#39;re
a-swelling yourself up like this.  I ain&#39;t the man to stand it--you hear?
Say, lemme hear you read.&quot;

I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
wars. When I&#39;d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:

&quot;It&#39;s so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky
here; you stop that putting on frills.  I won&#39;t have it.  I&#39;ll lay for
you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I&#39;ll tan you good.
First you know you&#39;ll get religion, too.  I never see such a son.&quot;

He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
says:

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something they give me for learning my lessons good.&quot;

He tore it up, and says:

&quot;I&#39;ll give you something better--I&#39;ll give you a cowhide.&quot;

He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:

&quot;_Ain&#39;t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and
a look&#39;n&#39;-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father
got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.  I never see such a son.  I
bet I&#39;ll take some o&#39; these frills out o&#39; you before I&#39;m done with you.
Why, there ain&#39;t no end to your airs--they say you&#39;re rich.  Hey?--how&#39;s
that?&quot;

&quot;They lie--that&#39;s how.&quot;

&quot;Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I&#39;m a-standing about all I can
stand now--so don&#39;t gimme no sass.  I&#39;ve been in town two days, and I
hain&#39;t heard nothing but about you bein&#39; rich.  I heard about it
away down the river, too.  That&#39;s why I come.  You git me that money
to-morrow--I want it.&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t got no money.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie.  Judge Thatcher&#39;s got it.  You git it.  I want it.&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher; he&#39;ll tell
you the same.&quot;

&quot;All right.  I&#39;ll ask him; and I&#39;ll make him pungle, too, or I&#39;ll know
the reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?  I want it.&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t got only a dollar, and I want that to--&quot;

&quot;It don&#39;t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it
out.&quot;

He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn&#39;t had a drink all day.
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick
me if I didn&#39;t drop that.

Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher&#39;s and bullyragged
him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn&#39;t, and then
he swore he&#39;d make the law force him.

The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
had just come, and he didn&#39;t know the old man; so he said courts mustn&#39;t
interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he&#39;d druther
not take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business.

That pleased the old man till he couldn&#39;t rest.  He said he&#39;d cowhide
me till I was black and blue if I didn&#39;t raise some money for him.  I
borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
him again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
of his son, and he&#39;d make it warm for _him_.

When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just
old pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he&#39;d been
a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn&#39;t be ashamed of, and he hoped the
judge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could
hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap
said he&#39;d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
judge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wanted
that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried
again.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his
hand, and says:

&quot;Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
There&#39;s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain&#39;t so no more; it&#39;s
the hand of a man that&#39;s started in on a new life, and&#39;ll die before
he&#39;ll go back.  You mark them words--don&#39;t forget I said them.  It&#39;s a
clean hand now; shake it--don&#39;t be afeard.&quot;

So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The
judge&#39;s wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made
his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it.

The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn&#39;t know no other way.




CHAPTER VI.

WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time.  I didn&#39;t want to go to school much
before, but I reckoned I&#39;d go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a
slow business--appeared like they warn&#39;t ever going to get started on it;
so every now and then I&#39;d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he
got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
every time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind
of thing was right in his line.

He got to hanging around the widow&#39;s too much and so she told him at
last that if he didn&#39;t quit using around there she would make trouble
for him. Well, _wasn&#39;t_ he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck
Finn&#39;s boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and
catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and
crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn&#39;t
no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick
you couldn&#39;t find it if you didn&#39;t know where it was.

He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.
We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
key under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little
while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
drunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where
I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn&#39;t long after that till I was
used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.

It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
and fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn&#39;t see how I&#39;d ever
got to like it so well at the widow&#39;s, where you had to wash, and eat on
a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
time.  I didn&#39;t want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because
the widow didn&#39;t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn&#39;t
no objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
all around.

But by and by pap got too handy with his hick&#39;ry, and I couldn&#39;t stand
it. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and
locking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was
dreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn&#39;t ever
going to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix
up some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many
a time, but I couldn&#39;t find no way.  There warn&#39;t a window to it big
enough for a dog to get through.  I couldn&#39;t get up the chimbly; it
was too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty
careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
the time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was an
old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin
behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
putting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,
and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
to let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap&#39;s gun in the woods.  I got rid of
the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
soon pap come in.

Pap warn&#39;t in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was
down town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge
Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there&#39;d be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up
considerable, because I didn&#39;t want to go back to the widow&#39;s any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man
got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn&#39;t skipped any,
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
including a considerable parcel of people which he didn&#39;t know the names
of, and so called them what&#39;s-his-name when he got to them, and went
right along with his cussing.

He said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch
out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldn&#39;t find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,
but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn&#39;t stay on hand till he got
that chance.

The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all
over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
take to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn&#39;t stay in one
place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldn&#39;t ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I
got so full of it I didn&#39;t notice how long I was staying till the old
man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While
I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,
and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body
would a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:

&quot;Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it&#39;s like.
Here&#39;s the law a-standing ready to take a man&#39;s son away from him--a
man&#39;s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety
and all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that
son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin&#39; for
_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call
_that_ govment!  That ain&#39;t all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge
Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o&#39; my property.  Here&#39;s what
the law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
up&#39;ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
him go round in clothes that ain&#39;t fitten for a hog. They call that
govment!  A man can&#39;t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes
I&#39;ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,
and I _told_ &#39;em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of &#39;em
heard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I&#39;d leave the
blamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them&#39;s the very words.  I
says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the
rest of it goes down till it&#39;s below my chin, and then it ain&#39;t rightly
a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o&#39;
stove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the
wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.

&quot;Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.
There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as
a white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
shiniest hat; and there ain&#39;t a man in that town that&#39;s got as fine
clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And
what do you think?  They said he was a p&#39;fessor in a college, and could
talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain&#39;t the
wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let me
out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was &#39;lection day,
and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn&#39;t too drunk to get
there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
they&#39;d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I&#39;ll never vote agin.
 Them&#39;s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
rot for all me--I&#39;ll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the
cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn&#39;t a give me the road if I hadn&#39;t
shoved him out o&#39; the way.  I says to the people, why ain&#39;t this nigger
put up at auction and sold?--that&#39;s what I want to know.  And what do you
reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn&#39;t be sold till he&#39;d been in
the State six months, and he hadn&#39;t been there that long yet.  There,
now--that&#39;s a specimen.  They call that a govment that can&#39;t sell a free
nigger till he&#39;s been in the State six months.  Here&#39;s a govment that
calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
govment, and yet&#39;s got to set stock-still for six whole months before
it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
nigger, and--&quot;

Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
the tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the
cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it
warn&#39;t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that
fairly made a body&#39;s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
anything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.
 He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.

After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
for two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I
judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
the key, or saw myself out, one or t&#39;other.  He drank and drank, and
tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn&#39;t run my way.
 He didn&#39;t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and
thrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so
sleepy I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.

I don&#39;t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was
crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn&#39;t see no snakes.  He started
and run round and round the cabin, hollering &quot;Take him off! take him
off! he&#39;s biting me on the neck!&quot;  I never see a man look so wild in the
eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid
still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn&#39;t make a sound.
 I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
seemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,
very low:

&quot;Tramp--tramp--tramp; that&#39;s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they&#39;re coming
after me; but I won&#39;t go.  Oh, they&#39;re here! don&#39;t touch me--don&#39;t! hands
off--they&#39;re cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!&quot;

Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could
hear him through the blanket.

By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
see me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a
clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
and then I couldn&#39;t come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I
was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and
dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would
sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.

So he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair
and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the
gun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I
laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did
drag along.




CHAPTER VII.

&quot;GIT up!  What you &#39;bout?&quot;

I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It
was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick, too.  He says:

&quot;What you doin&#39; with this gun?&quot;

I judged he didn&#39;t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:

&quot;Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you roust me out?&quot;

&quot;Well, I tried to, but I couldn&#39;t; I couldn&#39;t budge you.&quot;

&quot;Well, all right.  Don&#39;t stand there palavering all day, but out with
you and see if there&#39;s a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I&#39;ll be along
in a minute.&quot;

He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have
great times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be
always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs
together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
wood-yards and the sawmill.

I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t&#39;other one out
for what the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a
canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
high like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected
there&#39;d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they&#39;d
raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn&#39;t so this time.  It was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks
I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she&#39;s worth ten dollars.
 But when I got to shore pap wasn&#39;t in sight yet, and as I was running
her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I&#39;d hide her good, and then,
&#39;stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I&#39;d go down the river
about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around
a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just
drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn&#39;t seen anything.

When he got along I was hard at it taking up a &quot;trot&quot; line.  He abused
me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and
that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and
then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines
and went home.

While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about
wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
see, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn&#39;t see no way for a
while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water, and he says:

&quot;Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
hear? That man warn&#39;t here for no good.  I&#39;d a shot him.  Next time you
roust me out, you hear?&quot;

Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been
saying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it
now so nobody won&#39;t think of following me.

About twelve o&#39;clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The
river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.
 We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
more stuff; but that warn&#39;t pap&#39;s style.  Nine logs was enough for one
time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and
took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
 I judged he wouldn&#39;t come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he
had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
log again.  Before he was t&#39;other side of the river I was out of the
hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.

I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same
with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and
sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the
bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and
matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned
out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn&#39;t any, only the one out
at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched
out the gun, and now I was done.

I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up
at that place and didn&#39;t quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five
foot away and didn&#39;t know it was sawed, you wouldn&#39;t never notice
it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn&#39;t likely
anybody would go fooling around there.

It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn&#39;t left a track.  I
followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie
farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.

I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it
considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
that.

Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I
took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn&#39;t
drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag
of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
 I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
bottom of it with the saw, for there warn&#39;t no knives and forks on the
place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then
I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There
was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
miles away, I don&#39;t know where, but it didn&#39;t go to the river.  The meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped
pap&#39;s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by
accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it
wouldn&#39;t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.

It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I
made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid
down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,
they&#39;ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
drag the river for me.  And they&#39;ll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
that killed me and took the things.  They won&#39;t ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass. They&#39;ll soon get tired of that, and won&#39;t
bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.
Jackson&#39;s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,
and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson&#39;s Island&#39;s the
place.

I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When
I woke up I didn&#39;t know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked
around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and
miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.
You know what I mean--I don&#39;t know the words to put it in.

I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I
made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when it&#39;s a still night.  I peeped out through
the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.
 I couldn&#39;t tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was
abreast of me I see there warn&#39;t but one man in it.  Think&#39;s I, maybe
it&#39;s pap, though I warn&#39;t expecting him.  He dropped below me with the
current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.
 Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars.

I didn&#39;t lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,
and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of
the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and
people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and
then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.

 I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when
you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
 And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people
talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word
of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
nights now.  T&#39;other one said _this_ warn&#39;t one of the short ones, he
reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
laughed, but he didn&#39;t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
let him alone.  The first fellow said he &#39;lowed to tell it to his
old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn&#39;t
nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it
was nearly three o&#39;clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn&#39;t wait more than
about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,
and I couldn&#39;t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,
and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.

I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson&#39;s
Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like
a steamboat without any lights.  There warn&#39;t any signs of the bar at
the head--it was all under water now.

It didn&#39;t take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping
rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into
a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside.

I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A
monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,
with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,
and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, &quot;Stern
oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!&quot;  I heard that just as plain
as if the man was by my side.

There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and
laid down for a nap before breakfast.




CHAPTER VIII.

THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
o&#39;clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I
could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places
on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
very friendly.

I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn&#39;t want to get up and cook
breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
sound of &quot;boom!&quot; away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow
and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying
on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the
matter now.  &quot;Boom!&quot; I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat&#39;s
side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my
carcass come to the top.

I was pretty hungry, but it warn&#39;t going to do for me to start a fire,
because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the
cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,
and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I&#39;ll keep a lookout, and
if any of them&#39;s floating around after me I&#39;ll give them a show.  I
changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
have, and I warn&#39;t disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I
most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,
and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was &quot;baker&#39;s bread&quot;--what the
quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.

I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And
then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
and done it.  So there ain&#39;t no doubt but there is something in that
thing--that is, there&#39;s something in it when a body like the widow or the
parson prays, but it don&#39;t work for me, and I reckon it don&#39;t work for
only just the right kind.

I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The
ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I&#39;d have a chance
to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
close, where the bread did.  When she&#39;d got pretty well along down
towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where
the log forked I could peep through.

By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could
a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.
 Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.
 Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
says:

&quot;Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he&#39;s
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water&#39;s edge.  I
hope so, anyway.&quot;

I didn&#39;t hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see
them first-rate, but they couldn&#39;t see me.  Then the captain sung out:

&quot;Stand away!&quot; and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and
I judged I was gone.  If they&#39;d a had some bullets in, I reckon they&#39;d
a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn&#39;t hurt, thanks to
goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and
further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn&#39;t hear it no more.
 The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and
was giving it up.  But they didn&#39;t yet a while.  They turned around
the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,
under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over
to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the
island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
went home to the town.

I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after
me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
under so the rain couldn&#39;t get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled
him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.

When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;
there ain&#39;t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you
can&#39;t stay so, you soon get over it.

And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was
boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know
all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty
strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They
would all come handy by and by, I judged.

Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn&#39;t
far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn&#39;t shot
nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,
and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after
it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I
bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.

My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look
further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn&#39;t hear
nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my
breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.

When I got to camp I warn&#39;t feeling very brash, there warn&#39;t much sand
in my craw; but I says, this ain&#39;t no time to be fooling around.  So I
got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
old last year&#39;s camp, and then clumb a tree.

I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn&#39;t see nothing,
I didn&#39;t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a
thousand things.  Well, I couldn&#39;t stay up there forever; so at last I
got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the
time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from
breakfast.

By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good
and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and
cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there
all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says
to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people&#39;s voices.  I got
everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn&#39;t got far when I
hear a man say:

&quot;We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about
beat out.  Let&#39;s look around.&quot;

I didn&#39;t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the
old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.

I didn&#39;t sleep much.  I couldn&#39;t, somehow, for thinking.  And every time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn&#39;t
do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can&#39;t live this way; I&#39;m
a-going to find out who it is that&#39;s here on the island with me; I&#39;ll
find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.

So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was
shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
 I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A
little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying
the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge
of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the
leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket
the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards
where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two
to listen.  But I hadn&#39;t no luck somehow; I couldn&#39;t seem to find the
place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away
through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was
close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It
most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his
head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in
about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting
gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove
off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson&#39;s Jim!  I bet I was glad to see
him.  I says:

&quot;Hello, Jim!&quot; and skipped out.

He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,
and puts his hands together and says:

&quot;Doan&#39; hurt me--don&#39;t!  I hain&#39;t ever done no harm to a ghos&#39;.  I alwuz
liked dead people, en done all I could for &#39;em.  You go en git in de
river agin, whah you b&#39;longs, en doan&#39; do nuffn to Ole Jim, &#39;at &#39;uz
awluz yo&#39; fren&#39;.&quot;

Well, I warn&#39;t long making him understand I warn&#39;t dead.  I was ever so
glad to see Jim.  I warn&#39;t lonesome now.  I told him I warn&#39;t afraid of
_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set
there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:

&quot;It&#39;s good daylight.  Le&#39;s get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s de use er makin&#39; up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
truck? But you got a gun, hain&#39;t you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den
strawbries.&quot;

&quot;Strawberries and such truck,&quot; I says.  &quot;Is that what you live on?&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39; git nuffn else,&quot; he says.

&quot;Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?&quot;

&quot;I come heah de night arter you&#39;s killed.&quot;

&quot;What, all that time?&quot;

&quot;Yes--indeedy.&quot;

&quot;And ain&#39;t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?&quot;

&quot;No, sah--nuffn else.&quot;

&quot;Well, you must be most starved, ain&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I reck&#39;n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de
islan&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Since the night I got killed.&quot;

&quot;No!  W&#39;y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got
a gun.  Dat&#39;s good.  Now you kill sumfn en I&#39;ll make up de fire.&quot;

So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in
a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and
coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done
with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him
with his knife, and fried him.

When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then
when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by
Jim says:

&quot;But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat &#39;uz killed in dat shanty ef it
warn&#39;t you?&quot;

Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom
Sawyer couldn&#39;t get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:

&quot;How do you come to be here, Jim, and how&#39;d you get here?&quot;

He looked pretty uneasy, and didn&#39;t say nothing for a minute.  Then he
says:

&quot;Maybe I better not tell.&quot;

&quot;Why, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Well, dey&#39;s reasons.  But you wouldn&#39; tell on me ef I uz to tell you,
would you, Huck?&quot;

&quot;Blamed if I would, Jim.&quot;

&quot;Well, I b&#39;lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.&quot;

&quot;Jim!&quot;

&quot;But mind, you said you wouldn&#39; tell--you know you said you wouldn&#39; tell,
Huck.&quot;

&quot;Well, I did.  I said I wouldn&#39;t, and I&#39;ll stick to it.  Honest _injun_,
I will.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for
keeping mum--but that don&#39;t make no difference.  I ain&#39;t a-going to tell,
and I ain&#39;t a-going back there, anyways.  So, now, le&#39;s know all about
it.&quot;

&quot;Well, you see, it &#39;uz dis way.  Ole missus--dat&#39;s Miss Watson--she pecks
on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she
wouldn&#39; sell me down to Orleans.  But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader
roun&#39; de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.  Well, one
night I creeps to de do&#39; pooty late, en de do&#39; warn&#39;t quite shet, en I
hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but
she didn&#39; want to, but she could git eight hund&#39;d dollars for me, en it
&#39;uz sich a big stack o&#39; money she couldn&#39; resis&#39;.  De widder she try to
git her to say she wouldn&#39; do it, but I never waited to hear de res&#39;.  I
lit out mighty quick, I tell you.

&quot;I tuck out en shin down de hill, en &#39;spec to steal a skift &#39;long de
sho&#39; som&#39;ers &#39;bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid
in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to
go &#39;way. Well, I wuz dah all night.  Dey wuz somebody roun&#39; all de time.
 &#39;Long &#39;bout six in de mawnin&#39; skifts begin to go by, en &#39;bout eight er
nine every skift dat went &#39;long wuz talkin&#39; &#39;bout how yo&#39; pap come over
to de town en say you&#39;s killed.  Dese las&#39; skifts wuz full o&#39; ladies en
genlmen a-goin&#39; over for to see de place.  Sometimes dey&#39;d pull up at
de sho&#39; en take a res&#39; b&#39;fo&#39; dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
know all &#39;bout de killin&#39;.  I &#39;uz powerful sorry you&#39;s killed, Huck, but
I ain&#39;t no mo&#39; now.

&quot;I laid dah under de shavin&#39;s all day.  I &#39;uz hungry, but I warn&#39;t
afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin&#39; to start to
de camp-meet&#39;n&#39; right arter breakfas&#39; en be gone all day, en dey knows
I goes off wid de cattle &#39;bout daylight, so dey wouldn&#39; &#39;spec to see me
roun&#39; de place, en so dey wouldn&#39; miss me tell arter dark in de evenin&#39;.
De yuther servants wouldn&#39; miss me, kase dey&#39;d shin out en take holiday
soon as de ole folks &#39;uz out&#39;n de way.

&quot;Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went &#39;bout two
mile er more to whah dey warn&#39;t no houses.  I&#39;d made up my mine &#39;bout
what I&#39;s agwyne to do.  You see, ef I kep&#39; on tryin&#39; to git away afoot,
de dogs &#39;ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey&#39;d miss dat
skift, you see, en dey&#39;d know &#39;bout whah I&#39;d lan&#39; on de yuther side, en
whah to pick up my track.  So I says, a raff is what I&#39;s arter; it doan&#39;
_make_ no track.

&quot;I see a light a-comin&#39; roun&#39; de p&#39;int bymeby, so I wade&#39; in en shove&#39;
a log ahead o&#39; me en swum more&#39;n half way acrost de river, en got in
&#39;mongst de drift-wood, en kep&#39; my head down low, en kinder swum agin de
current tell de raff come along.  Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck
a-holt.  It clouded up en &#39;uz pooty dark for a little while.  So I clumb
up en laid down on de planks.  De men &#39;uz all &#39;way yonder in de middle,
whah de lantern wuz.  De river wuz a-risin&#39;, en dey wuz a good current;
so I reck&#39;n&#39;d &#39;at by fo&#39; in de mawnin&#39; I&#39;d be twenty-five mile down de
river, en den I&#39;d slip in jis b&#39;fo&#39; daylight en swim asho&#39;, en take to
de woods on de Illinois side.

&quot;But I didn&#39; have no luck.  When we &#39;uz mos&#39; down to de head er de
islan&#39; a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn&#39;t no use
fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan&#39;.  Well, I
had a notion I could lan&#39; mos&#39; anywhers, but I couldn&#39;t--bank too bluff.
 I &#39;uz mos&#39; to de foot er de islan&#39; b&#39;fo&#39; I found&#39; a good place.  I went
into de woods en jedged I wouldn&#39; fool wid raffs no mo&#39;, long as dey
move de lantern roun&#39; so.  I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some
matches in my cap, en dey warn&#39;t wet, so I &#39;uz all right.&quot;

&quot;And so you ain&#39;t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?  Why
didn&#39;t you get mud-turkles?&quot;

&quot;How you gwyne to git &#39;m?  You can&#39;t slip up on um en grab um; en how&#39;s
a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock?  How could a body do it in de night?
 En I warn&#39;t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s so.  You&#39;ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of
course. Did you hear &#39;em shooting the cannon?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes.  I knowed dey was arter you.  I see um go by heah--watched um
thoo de bushes.&quot;

Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and
lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it was
a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the
same way when young birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them,
but Jim wouldn&#39;t let me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laid
mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny
said his father would die, and he did.

And Jim said you mustn&#39;t count the things you are going to cook for
dinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook the
table-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehive
and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next
morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.
 Jim said bees wouldn&#39;t sting idiots; but I didn&#39;t believe that, because
I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn&#39;t sting me.

I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jim
knowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I said
it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
him if there warn&#39;t any good-luck signs.  He says:

&quot;Mighty few--an&#39; _dey_ ain&#39;t no use to a body.  What you want to know
when good luck&#39;s a-comin&#39; for?  Want to keep it off?&quot;  And he said:  &quot;Ef
you&#39;s got hairy arms en a hairy breas&#39;, it&#39;s a sign dat you&#39;s agwyne
to be rich. Well, dey&#39;s some use in a sign like dat, &#39;kase it&#39;s so fur
ahead. You see, maybe you&#39;s got to be po&#39; a long time fust, en so you
might git discourage&#39; en kill yo&#39;sef &#39;f you didn&#39; know by de sign dat
you gwyne to be rich bymeby.&quot;

&quot;Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s de use to ax dat question?  Don&#39;t you see I has?&quot;

&quot;Well, are you rich?&quot;

&quot;No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I had
foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat&#39;n&#39;, en got busted out.&quot;

&quot;What did you speculate in, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Well, fust I tackled stock.&quot;

&quot;What kind of stock?&quot;

&quot;Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  But
I ain&#39; gwyne to resk no mo&#39; money in stock.  De cow up &#39;n&#39; died on my
han&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;So you lost the ten dollars.&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t lose it all.  I on&#39;y los&#39; &#39;bout nine of it.  I sole de
hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.&quot;

&quot;You had five dollars and ten cents left.  Did you speculate any more?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b&#39;longs to old Misto
Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar
would git fo&#39; dollars mo&#39; at de en&#39; er de year.  Well, all de niggers
went in, but dey didn&#39;t have much.  I wuz de on&#39;y one dat had much.  So
I stuck out for mo&#39; dan fo&#39; dollars, en I said &#39;f I didn&#39; git it I&#39;d
start a bank mysef. Well, o&#39; course dat nigger want&#39; to keep me out er
de business, bekase he says dey warn&#39;t business &#39;nough for two banks, so
he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en&#39;
er de year.

&quot;So I done it.  Den I reck&#39;n&#39;d I&#39;d inves&#39; de thirty-five dollars right
off en keep things a-movin&#39;.  Dey wuz a nigger name&#39; Bob, dat had
ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn&#39; know it; en I bought it off&#39;n
him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en&#39; er de
year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de
one-laigged nigger say de bank&#39;s busted.  So dey didn&#39; none uv us git no
money.&quot;

&quot;What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Well, I &#39;uz gwyne to spen&#39; it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me
to give it to a nigger name&#39; Balum--Balum&#39;s Ass dey call him for short;
he&#39;s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.  But he&#39;s lucky, dey say, en I
see I warn&#39;t lucky.  De dream say let Balum inves&#39; de ten cents en he&#39;d
make a raise for me.  Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in
church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po&#39; len&#39; to de
Lord, en boun&#39; to git his money back a hund&#39;d times.  So Balum he tuck
en give de ten cents to de po&#39;, en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to
come of it.&quot;

&quot;Well, what did come of it, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Nuffn never come of it.  I couldn&#39; manage to k&#39;leck dat money no way;
en Balum he couldn&#39;.  I ain&#39; gwyne to len&#39; no mo&#39; money &#39;dout I see de
security.  Boun&#39; to git yo&#39; money back a hund&#39;d times, de preacher says!
Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I&#39;d call it squah, en be glad er de
chanst.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s all right anyway, Jim, long as you&#39;re going to be rich again
some time or other.&quot;

&quot;Yes; en I&#39;s rich now, come to look at it.  I owns mysef, en I&#39;s wuth
eight hund&#39;d dollars.  I wisht I had de money, I wouldn&#39; want no mo&#39;.&quot;




CHAPTER IX.

I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that I&#39;d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide.

This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the
side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in
there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
didn&#39;t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,
and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
get wet?

So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,
and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by
to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off
of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.

The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty
soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,
too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular
summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black
outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that
the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would
come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the
pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would
follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you&#39;d have a little
glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
in a second, and now you&#39;d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where
it&#39;s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.

&quot;Jim, this is nice,&quot; I says.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to be nowhere else but
here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.&quot;

&quot;Well, you wouldn&#39;t a ben here &#39;f it hadn&#39;t a ben for Jim.  You&#39;d a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn&#39; mos&#39; drownded, too;
dat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it&#39;s gwyne to rain, en so do
de birds, chile.&quot;

The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at
last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on
the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side
it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same
old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs.

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We
went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung
so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old
broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would
slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.
We could a had pets enough if we&#39;d wanted them.

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and
the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We
could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;
we didn&#39;t show ourselves in daylight.

Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was
a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got
aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,
so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then
we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and
two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:

&quot;Hello, you!&quot;

But it didn&#39;t budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:

&quot;De man ain&#39;t asleep--he&#39;s dead.  You hold still--I&#39;ll go en see.&quot;

He went, and bent down and looked, and says:

&quot;It&#39;s a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He&#39;s ben shot in de back.
I reck&#39;n he&#39;s ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan&#39; look
at his face--it&#39;s too gashly.&quot;

I didn&#39;t look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but
he needn&#39;t done it; I didn&#39;t want to see him.  There was heaps of old
greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
 There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
women&#39;s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men&#39;s clothing,
too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a
boy&#39;s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there
was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was
a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They
stood open, but there warn&#39;t nothing left in them that was any account.
 The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
hurry, and warn&#39;t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.

We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and
a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet
and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn&#39;t have no label
on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,
and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps
was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though
it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn&#39;t find
the other one, though we hunted all around.

And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty
broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most
a half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and
hadn&#39;t no accidents and didn&#39;t see nobody.  We got home all safe.




CHAPTER X.

AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed, but Jim didn&#39;t want to.  He said it would fetch bad
luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha&#39;nt us; he said a man
that warn&#39;t buried was more likely to go a-ha&#39;nting around than one
that was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so
I didn&#39;t say no more; but I couldn&#39;t keep from studying over it and
wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.

We rummaged the clothes we&#39;d got, and found eight dollars in silver
sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned
the people in that house stole the coat, because if they&#39;d a knowed the
money was there they wouldn&#39;t a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed
him, too; but Jim didn&#39;t want to talk about that.  I says:

&quot;Now you think it&#39;s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin
with my hands.  Well, here&#39;s your bad luck!  We&#39;ve raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck
like this every day, Jim.&quot;

&quot;Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don&#39;t you git too peart.  It&#39;s
a-comin&#39;.  Mind I tell you, it&#39;s a-comin&#39;.&quot;

It did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and
found a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the
foot of Jim&#39;s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there&#39;d be some fun
when Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
the snake&#39;s mate was there, and bit him.

He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a
second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap&#39;s whisky-jug and begun to pour
it down.

He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told
me to chop off the snake&#39;s head and throw it away, and then skin the
body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around
his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet
and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn&#39;t going
to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.

Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
went to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and
so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged
he was all right; but I&#39;d druther been bit with a snake than pap&#39;s
whisky.

Jim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all
gone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn&#39;t ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said
that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn&#39;t
got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I&#39;ve
always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank
Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
they say, but I didn&#39;t see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of
looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds. We couldn&#39;t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,
and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he&#39;d had it there a long time, to
coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn&#39;t ever seen
a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
 They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house
there; everybody buys some of him; his meat&#39;s as white as snow and makes
a good fry.

Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I
must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,
couldn&#39;t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
 That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico
gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said
nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around
all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty
well in them, only Jim said I didn&#39;t walk like a girl; and he said
I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took
notice, and done better.

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.

I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I
tied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a
little shanty that hadn&#39;t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the
window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn&#39;t know her face; she was a
stranger, for you couldn&#39;t start a face in that town that I didn&#39;t know.
 Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had
come; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had
been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to
know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn&#39;t forget I
was a girl.




CHAPTER XI.

&quot;COME in,&quot; says the woman, and I did.  She says:  &quot;Take a cheer.&quot;

I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:

&quot;What might your name be?&quot;

&quot;Sarah Williams.&quot;

&quot;Where &#39;bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?&#39;

&quot;No&#39;m.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I&#39;ve walked all the way and
I&#39;m all tired out.&quot;

&quot;Hungry, too, I reckon.  I&#39;ll find you something.&quot;

&quot;No&#39;m, I ain&#39;t hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
here at a farm; so I ain&#39;t hungry no more.  It&#39;s what makes me so late.
My mother&#39;s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to
tell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, she
says.  I hain&#39;t ever been here before.  Do you know him?&quot;

&quot;No; but I don&#39;t know everybody yet.  I haven&#39;t lived here quite two
weeks. It&#39;s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  You
better stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I says; &quot;I&#39;ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain&#39;t afeared
of the dark.&quot;

She said she wouldn&#39;t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in
by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she&#39;d send him along with me.
Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up
the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
off they used to was, and how they didn&#39;t know but they&#39;d made a mistake
coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
 She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  I
says:

&quot;Who done it?  We&#39;ve heard considerable about these goings on down in
Hookerville, but we don&#39;t know who &#39;twas that killed Huck Finn.&quot;

&quot;Well, I reckon there&#39;s a right smart chance of people _here_ that&#39;d
like to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.&quot;

&quot;No--is that so?&quot;

&quot;Most everybody thought it at first.  He&#39;ll never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged it
was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.&quot;

&quot;Why _he_--&quot;

I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never
noticed I had put in at all:

&quot;The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there&#39;s a
reward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there&#39;s a reward out for
old Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town the
morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with &#39;em on the
ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night they
wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they
found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn&#39;t ben seen sence
ten o&#39;clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,
you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,
and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the
nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening
he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain&#39;t
come back sence, and they ain&#39;t looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he&#39;d get
Huck&#39;s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
 People do say he warn&#39;t any too good to do it.  Oh, he&#39;s sly, I reckon.
 If he don&#39;t come back for a year he&#39;ll be all right.  You can&#39;t prove
anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and
he&#39;ll walk in Huck&#39;s money as easy as nothing.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I reckon so, &#39;m.  I don&#39;t see nothing in the way of it.  Has
everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they&#39;ll get
the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.&quot;

&quot;Why, are they after him yet?&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re innocent, ain&#39;t you!  Does three hundred dollars lay
around every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the nigger
ain&#39;t far from here.  I&#39;m one of them--but I hain&#39;t talked it around.  A
few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in
the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to
that island over yonder that they call Jackson&#39;s Island.  Don&#39;t anybody
live there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn&#39;t say any more, but
I done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I&#39;d seen smoke over
there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
to myself, like as not that nigger&#39;s hiding over there; anyway, says
I, it&#39;s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain&#39;t seen any
smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he&#39;s gone, if it was him; but husband&#39;s
going over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but he
got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.&quot;

I had got so uneasy I couldn&#39;t set still.  I had to do something with my
hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading
it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the woman
stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious
and smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on to
be interested--and I was, too--and says:

&quot;Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could get
it. Is your husband going over there to-night?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a
boat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They&#39;ll go over after
midnight.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  And couldn&#39;t the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he&#39;ll
likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he&#39;s got one.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think of that.&quot;

The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn&#39;t feel a bit
comfortable.  Pretty soon she says,

&quot;What did you say your name was, honey?&quot;

&quot;M--Mary Williams.&quot;

Somehow it didn&#39;t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn&#39;t
look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,
and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would
say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But
now she says:

&quot;Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes&#39;m, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah&#39;s my first name.  Some
calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s the way of it?&quot;

&quot;Yes&#39;m.&quot;

I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  I
couldn&#39;t look up yet.

Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right
about the rats. You&#39;d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone, or they wouldn&#39;t give her no peace.  She showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
with it generly, but she&#39;d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn&#39;t
know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,
and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said
&quot;Ouch!&quot; it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.
 I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course
I didn&#39;t let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his
nose I let drive, and if he&#39;d a stayed where he was he&#39;d a been a
tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I
would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched
it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help
her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
went on talking about her and her husband&#39;s matters.  But she broke off
to say:

&quot;Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,
handy.&quot;

So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped
my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a
minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,
and very pleasant, and says:

&quot;Come, now, what&#39;s your real name?&quot;

&quot;Wh--what, mum?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?&quot;

I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn&#39;t know hardly what to do.  But
I says:

&quot;Please to don&#39;t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I&#39;m in the
way here, I&#39;ll--&quot;

&quot;No, you won&#39;t.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain&#39;t going to hurt
you, and I ain&#39;t going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your
secret, and trust me.  I&#39;ll keep it; and, what&#39;s more, I&#39;ll help
you. So&#39;ll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you&#39;re a runaway
&#39;prentice, that&#39;s all.  It ain&#39;t anything.  There ain&#39;t no harm in it.
You&#39;ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,
child, I wouldn&#39;t tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that&#39;s a good
boy.&quot;

So I said it wouldn&#39;t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I
would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn&#39;t
go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,
and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn&#39;t stand it
no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
chance and stole some of his daughter&#39;s old clothes and cleared out, and
I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,
and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my
uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck
out for this town of Goshen.

&quot;Goshen, child?  This ain&#39;t Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen&#39;s
ten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?&quot;

&quot;Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I
must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.&quot;

&quot;He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.&quot;

&quot;Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain&#39;t no matter now.  I got
to be moving along.  I&#39;ll fetch Goshen before daylight.&quot;

&quot;Hold on a minute.  I&#39;ll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.&quot;

So she put me up a snack, and says:

&quot;Say, when a cow&#39;s laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer
up prompt now--don&#39;t stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?&quot;

&quot;The hind end, mum.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, a horse?&quot;

&quot;The for&#39;rard end, mum.&quot;

&quot;Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?&quot;

&quot;North side.&quot;

&quot;If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with
their heads pointed the same direction?&quot;

&quot;The whole fifteen, mum.&quot;

&quot;Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you
was trying to hocus me again.  What&#39;s your real name, now?&quot;

&quot;George Peters, mum.&quot;

&quot;Well, try to remember it, George.  Don&#39;t forget and tell me it&#39;s
Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it&#39;s George
Elexander when I catch you.  And don&#39;t go about women in that old
calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.
 Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don&#39;t hold the
thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and
poke the thread at it; that&#39;s the way a woman most always does, but a
man always does t&#39;other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,
hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw
stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out
to one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don&#39;t clap them
together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I
spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived
the other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,
Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble
you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I&#39;ll do what I can
to get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time
you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road&#39;s a rocky one,
and your feet&#39;ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.&quot;

I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I
jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to
make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the
sun-bonnet, for I didn&#39;t want no blinders on then.  When I was about the
middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the
head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot.

Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
below, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on
the ground.  I roused him out and says:

&quot;Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain&#39;t a minute to lose.  They&#39;re
after us!&quot;

Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By
that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was
ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We
put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn&#39;t show a
candle outside after that.

I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;
but if there was a boat around I couldn&#39;t see it, for stars and shadows
ain&#39;t good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down
in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a
word.




CHAPTER XII.

IT must a been close on to one o&#39;clock when we got below the island at
last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois
shore; and it was well a boat didn&#39;t come, for we hadn&#39;t ever thought to
put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We
was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn&#39;t
good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.

If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed
away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn&#39;t no
fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.

When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
warn&#39;t afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,
and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all
about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was
a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn&#39;t set
down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she&#39;d fetch a dog.  Well, then, I
said, why couldn&#39;t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
time, or else we wouldn&#39;t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.
 So I said I didn&#39;t care what was the reason they didn&#39;t get us as long
as they didn&#39;t.

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug
wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things
dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above
the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of
reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for
to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather
or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra
steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag
or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn&#39;t have
to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call
a &quot;crossing&quot;; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being
still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn&#39;t always run the
channel, but hunted easy water.

This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,
and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of
solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
up at the stars, and we didn&#39;t ever feel like talking loud, and it
warn&#39;t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We
had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.

Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The
fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two o&#39;clock that still night.  There warn&#39;t a sound
there; everybody was asleep.

Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o&#39;clock at some little
village, and buy ten or fifteen cents&#39; worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn&#39;t roosting
comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you don&#39;t want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed ain&#39;t ever forgot.  I never see
pap when he didn&#39;t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway.

Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
that kind.  Pap always said it warn&#39;t no harm to borrow things if you
was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn&#39;t
anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
 Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
from the list and say we wouldn&#39;t borrow them any more--then he reckoned
it wouldn&#39;t be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all
one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,
or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and
concluded to drop crabapples and p&#39;simmons.  We warn&#39;t feeling just
right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way
it come out, too, because crabapples ain&#39;t ever good, and the p&#39;simmons
wouldn&#39;t be ripe for two or three months yet.

We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning
or didn&#39;t go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we
lived pretty high.

The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, &quot;Hel-_lo_, Jim,
looky yonder!&quot; It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.
 We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very
distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
when the flashes come.

Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,
I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
there was there.  So I says:

&quot;Le&#39;s land on her, Jim.&quot;

But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:

&quot;I doan&#39; want to go fool&#39;n &#39;long er no wrack.  We&#39;s doin&#39; blame&#39; well,
en we better let blame&#39; well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not
dey&#39;s a watchman on dat wrack.&quot;

&quot;Watchman your grandmother,&quot; I says; &quot;there ain&#39;t nothing to watch but
the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody&#39;s going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when
it&#39;s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?&quot;  Jim
couldn&#39;t say nothing to that, so he didn&#39;t try.  &quot;And besides,&quot; I says,
&quot;we might borrow something worth having out of the captain&#39;s stateroom.
 Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don&#39;t
care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a
candle in your pocket; I can&#39;t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
 Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he
wouldn&#39;t. He&#39;d call it an adventure--that&#39;s what he&#39;d call it; and he&#39;d
land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn&#39;t he throw style
into it?--wouldn&#39;t he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you&#39;d think it
was Christopher C&#39;lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer
_was_ here.&quot;

Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn&#39;t talk any more
than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us
the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and
made fast there.

The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
dark we couldn&#39;t see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
front of the captain&#39;s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we
seem to hear low voices in yonder!

Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just
then I heard a voice wail out and say:

&quot;Oh, please don&#39;t, boys; I swear I won&#39;t ever tell!&quot;

Another voice said, pretty loud:

&quot;It&#39;s a lie, Jim Turner.  You&#39;ve acted this way before.  You always want
more&#39;n your share of the truck, and you&#39;ve always got it, too, because
you&#39;ve swore &#39;t if you didn&#39;t you&#39;d tell.  But this time you&#39;ve said
it jest one time too many.  You&#39;re the meanest, treacherousest hound in
this country.&quot;

By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with
curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn&#39;t back out now,
and so I won&#39;t either; I&#39;m a-going to see what&#39;s going on here.  So I
dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
in the dark till there warn&#39;t but one stateroom betwixt me and the
cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the
floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.
 This one kept pointing the pistol at the man&#39;s head on the floor, and
saying:

&quot;I&#39;d _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!&quot;

The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, &quot;Oh, please don&#39;t, Bill;
I hain&#39;t ever goin&#39; to tell.&quot;

And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and
say:

&quot;&#39;Deed you _ain&#39;t!_  You never said no truer thing &#39;n that, you bet
you.&quot; And once he said:  &quot;Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn&#39;t got the
best of him and tied him he&#39;d a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist
for noth&#39;n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that&#39;s what for.  But
I lay you ain&#39;t a-goin&#39; to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put
_up_ that pistol, Bill.&quot;

Bill says:

&quot;I don&#39;t want to, Jake Packard.  I&#39;m for killin&#39; him--and didn&#39;t he kill
old Hatfield jist the same way--and don&#39;t he deserve it?&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t _want_ him killed, and I&#39;ve got my reasons for it.&quot;

&quot;Bless yo&#39; heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I&#39;ll never forgit you
long&#39;s I live!&quot; says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.

Packard didn&#39;t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill
to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
slanted so that I couldn&#39;t make very good time; so to keep from getting
run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.
 The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my
stateroom, he says:

&quot;Here--come in here.&quot;

And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up
in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,
with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn&#39;t see
them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they&#39;d been having.
 I was glad I didn&#39;t drink whisky; but it wouldn&#39;t made much difference
anyway, because most of the time they couldn&#39;t a treed me because I
didn&#39;t breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn&#39;t_
breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted
to kill Turner.  He says:

&quot;He&#39;s said he&#39;ll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares
to him _now_ it wouldn&#39;t make no difference after the row and the way
we&#39;ve served him.  Shore&#39;s you&#39;re born, he&#39;ll turn State&#39;s evidence; now
you hear _me_.  I&#39;m for putting him out of his troubles.&quot;

&quot;So&#39;m I,&quot; says Packard, very quiet.

&quot;Blame it, I&#39;d sorter begun to think you wasn&#39;t.  Well, then, that&#39;s all
right.  Le&#39;s go and do it.&quot;

&quot;Hold on a minute; I hain&#39;t had my say yit.  You listen to me.
Shooting&#39;s good, but there&#39;s quieter ways if the thing&#39;s _got_ to be
done. But what I say is this:  it ain&#39;t good sense to go court&#39;n around
after a halter if you can git at what you&#39;re up to in some way that&#39;s
jist as good and at the same time don&#39;t bring you into no resks.  Ain&#39;t
that so?&quot;

&quot;You bet it is.  But how you goin&#39; to manage it this time?&quot;

&quot;Well, my idea is this:  we&#39;ll rustle around and gather up whatever
pickins we&#39;ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
the truck. Then we&#39;ll wait.  Now I say it ain&#39;t a-goin&#39; to be more&#39;n two
hours befo&#39; this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?
He&#39;ll be drownded, and won&#39;t have nobody to blame for it but his own
self.  I reckon that&#39;s a considerble sight better &#39;n killin&#39; of him.
 I&#39;m unfavorable to killin&#39; a man as long as you can git aroun&#39; it; it
ain&#39;t good sense, it ain&#39;t good morals.  Ain&#39;t I right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I reck&#39;n you are.  But s&#39;pose she _don&#39;t_ break up and wash off?&quot;

&quot;Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;All right, then; come along.&quot;

So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
whisper, &quot;Jim!&quot; and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
moan, and I says:

&quot;Quick, Jim, it ain&#39;t no time for fooling around and moaning; there&#39;s a
gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don&#39;t hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows can&#39;t get away from the
wreck there&#39;s one of &#39;em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their
boat we can put _all_ of &#39;em in a bad fix--for the sheriff &#39;ll get &#39;em.
Quick--hurry!  I&#39;ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You
start at the raft, and--&quot;

&quot;Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf&#39;_?  Dey ain&#39; no raf&#39; no mo&#39;; she done broke
loose en gone I--en here we is!&quot;




CHAPTER XIII.

WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with
such a gang as that!  But it warn&#39;t no time to be sentimentering.  We&#39;d
_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went
a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,
too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim
said he didn&#39;t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn&#39;t
hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left
on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck
for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the
edge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the
cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely
see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been
aboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his
head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;
but he jerked it in again, and says:

&quot;Heave that blame lantern out o&#39; sight, Bill!&quot;

He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and
set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard
says, in a low voice:

&quot;All ready--shove off!&quot;

I couldn&#39;t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill
says:

&quot;Hold on--&#39;d you go through him?&quot;

&quot;No.  Didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;No.  So he&#39;s got his share o&#39; the cash yet.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.&quot;

&quot;Say, won&#39;t he suspicion what we&#39;re up to?&quot;

&quot;Maybe he won&#39;t.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.&quot;

So they got out and went in.

The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half
second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my
knife and cut the rope, and away we went!

We didn&#39;t touch an oar, and we didn&#39;t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even
breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the
paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every
last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.

When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern
show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed
by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.

Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the
first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn&#39;t
had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for
murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain&#39;t no
telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would
I like it?  So says I to Jim:

&quot;The first light we see we&#39;ll land a hundred yards below it or above
it, in a place where it&#39;s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and
then I&#39;ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for
that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when
their time comes.&quot;

But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,
and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light
showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,
watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the
rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
made for it.

It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We
seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would
go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told
Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars
and shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more
showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore
light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed
around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and
by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between
his knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to
cry.

He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only
me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:

&quot;Hello, what&#39;s up?  Don&#39;t cry, bub.  What&#39;s the trouble?&quot;

I says:

&quot;Pap, and mam, and sis, and--&quot;

Then I broke down.  He says:

&quot;Oh, dang it now, _don&#39;t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,
and this &#39;n &#39;ll come out all right.  What&#39;s the matter with &#39;em?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re--they&#39;re--are you the watchman of the boat?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  &quot;I&#39;m the captain
and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head
deck-hand; and sometimes I&#39;m the freight and passengers.  I ain&#39;t as
rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can&#39;t be so blame&#39; generous and good
to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he
does; but I&#39;ve told him a many a time &#39;t I wouldn&#39;t trade places with
him; for, says I, a sailor&#39;s life&#39;s the life for me, and I&#39;m derned if
_I&#39;d_ live two mile out o&#39; town, where there ain&#39;t nothing ever goin&#39;
on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--&quot;

I broke in and says:

&quot;They&#39;re in an awful peck of trouble, and--&quot;

&quot;_Who_ is?&quot;

&quot;Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you&#39;d take your
ferryboat and go up there--&quot;

&quot;Up where?  Where are they?&quot;

&quot;On the wreck.&quot;

&quot;What wreck?&quot;

&quot;Why, there ain&#39;t but one.&quot;

&quot;What, you don&#39;t mean the Walter Scott?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Good land! what are they doin&#39; _there_, for gracious sakes?&quot;

&quot;Well, they didn&#39;t go there a-purpose.&quot;

&quot;I bet they didn&#39;t!  Why, great goodness, there ain&#39;t no chance for &#39;em
if they don&#39;t git off mighty quick!  Why, how in the nation did they
ever git into such a scrape?&quot;

&quot;Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--&quot;

&quot;Yes, Booth&#39;s Landing--go on.&quot;

&quot;She was a-visiting there at Booth&#39;s Landing, and just in the edge of
the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry
to stay all night at her friend&#39;s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I
disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung
around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and
saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and
the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard
the wreck.  Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our
trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn&#39;t notice the wreck till we was
right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but
Bill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish &#39;t it had
been me, I do.&quot;

&quot;My George!  It&#39;s the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And _then_ what
did you all do?&quot;

&quot;Well, we hollered and took on, but it&#39;s so wide there we couldn&#39;t
make nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,
and Miss Hooker she said if I didn&#39;t strike help sooner, come here and
hunt up her uncle, and he&#39;d fix the thing.  I made the land about a mile
below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do
something, but they said, &#39;What, in such a night and such a current?
There ain&#39;t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.&#39;  Now if you&#39;ll go
and--&quot;

&quot;By Jackson, I&#39;d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don&#39;t know but I will; but
who in the dingnation&#39;s a-going&#39; to _pay_ for it?  Do you reckon your
pap--&quot;

&quot;Why _that&#39;s_ all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that
her uncle Hornback--&quot;

&quot;Great guns! is _he_ her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that light
over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a
quarter of a mile out you&#39;ll come to the tavern; tell &#39;em to dart you
out to Jim Hornback&#39;s, and he&#39;ll foot the bill.  And don&#39;t you fool
around any, because he&#39;ll want to know the news.  Tell him I&#39;ll have
his niece all safe before he can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I&#39;m
a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.&quot;

I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in
the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among
some woodboats; for I couldn&#39;t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat
start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on
accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would
a done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be
proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and
dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest
in.

Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along
down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for
her.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn&#39;t much chance
for anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollered
a little, but there wasn&#39;t any answer; all dead still.  I felt a little
bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they
could stand it I could.

Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river
on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach
I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the
wreck for Miss Hooker&#39;s remainders, because the captain would know her
uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give
it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming
down the river.

It did seem a powerful long time before Jim&#39;s light showed up; and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time I
got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we
struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned
in and slept like dead people.




CHAPTER XIV.

BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
boxes of seegars.  We hadn&#39;t ever been this rich before in neither of
our lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
he didn&#39;t want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
be fixed; for if he didn&#39;t get saved he would get drownded; and if he
did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, he
was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
nigger.

I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, &#39;stead
of mister; and Jim&#39;s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:

&quot;I didn&#39; know dey was so many un um.  I hain&#39;t hearn &#39;bout none un um,
skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat&#39;s in a
pack er k&#39;yards.  How much do a king git?&quot;

&quot;Get?&quot;  I says; &quot;why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to
them.&quot;

&quot;_Ain&#39;_ dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?&quot;

&quot;_They_ don&#39;t do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set around.&quot;

&quot;No; is dat so?&quot;

&quot;Of course it is.  They just set around--except, maybe, when there&#39;s a
war; then they go to the war.  But other times they just lazy around; or
go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d&#39; you hear a noise?&quot;

We skipped out and looked; but it warn&#39;t nothing but the flutter of a
steamboat&#39;s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.

&quot;Yes,&quot; says I, &quot;and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the
parlyment; and if everybody don&#39;t go just so he whacks their heads off.
But mostly they hang round the harem.&quot;

&quot;Roun&#39; de which?&quot;

&quot;Harem.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s de harem?&quot;

&quot;The place where he keeps his wives.  Don&#39;t you know about the harem?
Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.&quot;

&quot;Why, yes, dat&#39;s so; I--I&#39;d done forgot it.  A harem&#39;s a bo&#39;d&#39;n-house, I
reck&#39;n.  Mos&#39; likely dey has rackety times in de nussery.  En I reck&#39;n
de wives quarrels considable; en dat &#39;crease de racket.  Yit dey say
Sollermun de wises&#39; man dat ever live&#39;.  I doan&#39; take no stock in
dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids&#39; er sich a
blim-blammin&#39; all de time?  No--&#39;deed he wouldn&#39;t.  A wise man &#39;ud take
en buil&#39; a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry
when he want to res&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told
me so, her own self.&quot;

&quot;I doan k&#39;yer what de widder say, he _warn&#39;t_ no wise man nuther.  He
had some er de dad-fetchedes&#39; ways I ever see.  Does you know &#39;bout dat
chile dat he &#39;uz gwyne to chop in two?&quot;

&quot;Yes, the widow told me all about it.&quot;

&quot;_Well_, den!  Warn&#39; dat de beatenes&#39; notion in de worl&#39;?  You jes&#39;
take en look at it a minute.  Dah&#39;s de stump, dah--dat&#39;s one er de women;
heah&#39;s you--dat&#39;s de yuther one; I&#39;s Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill&#39;s
de chile.  Bofe un you claims it.  What does I do?  Does I shin aroun&#39;
mongs&#39; de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b&#39;long to, en
han&#39; it over to de right one, all safe en soun&#39;, de way dat anybody dat
had any gumption would?  No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give
half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.  Dat&#39;s de way
Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.  Now I want to ast you:  what&#39;s
de use er dat half a bill?--can&#39;t buy noth&#39;n wid it.  En what use is a
half a chile?  I wouldn&#39; give a dern for a million un um.&quot;

&quot;But hang it, Jim, you&#39;ve clean missed the point--blame it, you&#39;ve missed
it a thousand mile.&quot;

&quot;Who?  Me?  Go &#39;long.  Doan&#39; talk to me &#39;bout yo&#39; pints.  I reck&#39;n I
knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain&#39; no sense in sich doin&#39;s as
dat. De &#39;spute warn&#39;t &#39;bout a half a chile, de &#39;spute was &#39;bout a whole
chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a &#39;spute &#39;bout a whole chile
wid a half a chile doan&#39; know enough to come in out&#39;n de rain.  Doan&#39;
talk to me &#39;bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.&quot;

&quot;But I tell you you don&#39;t get the point.&quot;

&quot;Blame de point!  I reck&#39;n I knows what I knows.  En mine you, de _real_
pint is down furder--it&#39;s down deeper.  It lays in de way Sollermun was
raised.  You take a man dat&#39;s got on&#39;y one or two chillen; is dat man
gwyne to be waseful o&#39; chillen?  No, he ain&#39;t; he can&#39;t &#39;ford it.  _He_
know how to value &#39;em.  But you take a man dat&#39;s got &#39;bout five million
chillen runnin&#39; roun&#39; de house, en it&#39;s diffunt.  _He_ as soon chop a
chile in two as a cat. Dey&#39;s plenty mo&#39;.  A chile er two, mo&#39; er less,
warn&#39;t no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!&quot;

I never see such a nigger.  If he got a notion in his head once, there
warn&#39;t no getting it out again.  He was the most down on Solomon of
any nigger I ever see.  So I went to talking about other kings, and let
Solomon slide.  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off
in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that
would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say
he died there.

&quot;Po&#39; little chap.&quot;

&quot;But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.&quot;

&quot;Dat&#39;s good!  But he&#39;ll be pooty lonesome--dey ain&#39; no kings here, is
dey, Huck?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Den he cain&#39;t git no situation.  What he gwyne to do?&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know.  Some of them gets on the police, and some of them
learns people how to talk French.&quot;

&quot;Why, Huck, doan&#39; de French people talk de same way we does?&quot;

&quot;_No_, Jim; you couldn&#39;t understand a word they said--not a single word.&quot;

&quot;Well, now, I be ding-busted!  How do dat come?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know; but it&#39;s so.  I got some of their jabber out of a book.
S&#39;pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you
think?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39; think nuff&#39;n; I&#39;d take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he
warn&#39;t white.  I wouldn&#39;t &#39;low no nigger to call me dat.&quot;

&quot;Shucks, it ain&#39;t calling you anything.  It&#39;s only saying, do you know
how to talk French?&quot;

&quot;Well, den, why couldn&#39;t he _say_ it?&quot;

&quot;Why, he _is_ a-saying it.  That&#39;s a Frenchman&#39;s _way_ of saying it.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a blame ridicklous way, en I doan&#39; want to hear no mo&#39; &#39;bout
it.  Dey ain&#39; no sense in it.&quot;

&quot;Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?&quot;

&quot;No, a cat don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Well, does a cow?&quot;

&quot;No, a cow don&#39;t, nuther.&quot;

&quot;Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?&quot;

&quot;No, dey don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s natural and right for &#39;em to talk different from each other, ain&#39;t
it?&quot;

&quot;Course.&quot;

&quot;And ain&#39;t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different
from _us_?&quot;

&quot;Why, mos&#39; sholy it is.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, why ain&#39;t it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk
different from us?  You answer me that.&quot;

&quot;Is a cat a man, Huck?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well, den, dey ain&#39;t no sense in a cat talkin&#39; like a man.  Is a cow a
man?--er is a cow a cat?&quot;

&quot;No, she ain&#39;t either of them.&quot;

&quot;Well, den, she ain&#39;t got no business to talk like either one er the
yuther of &#39;em.  Is a Frenchman a man?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;_Well_, den!  Dad blame it, why doan&#39; he _talk_ like a man?  You answer
me _dat_!&quot;

I see it warn&#39;t no use wasting words--you can&#39;t learn a nigger to argue.
So I quit.




CHAPTER XV.

WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom
of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was
after.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.

Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead
to tie to, for it wouldn&#39;t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled
ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn&#39;t anything
but little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of them
right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and
the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and
away she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and
scared I couldn&#39;t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and
then there warn&#39;t no raft in sight; you couldn&#39;t see twenty yards.  I
jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle
and set her back a stroke.  But she didn&#39;t come.  I was in such a hurry
I hadn&#39;t untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so
excited my hands shook so I couldn&#39;t hardly do anything with them.

As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right
down the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead
warn&#39;t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
out into the solid white fog, and hadn&#39;t no more idea which way I was
going than a dead man.

Thinks I, it won&#39;t do to paddle; first I know I&#39;ll run into the bank
or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it&#39;s
mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.
 I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a small
whoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listening
sharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn&#39;t heading
for it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I was
heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for
I was flying around, this way and that and t&#39;other, but it was going
straight ahead all the time.

I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
that was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directly
I hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That was
somebody else&#39;s whoop, or else I was turned around.

I throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind me
yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its
place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,
and I knowed the current had swung the canoe&#39;s head down-stream, and I
was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.
 I couldn&#39;t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don&#39;t look
natural nor sound natural in a fog.

The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed
me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly
roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.

In another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I set
perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn&#39;t
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.

I just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bank
was an island, and Jim had gone down t&#39;other side of it.  It warn&#39;t no
towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timber
of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than
half a mile wide.

I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  I
was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don&#39;t
ever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on
the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don&#39;t think to
yourself how fast _you&#39;re_ going, but you catch your breath and think,
my! how that snag&#39;s tearing along.  If you think it ain&#39;t dismal and
lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it
once--you&#39;ll see.

Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears
the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn&#39;t do
it, and directly I judged I&#39;d got into a nest of towheads, for I had
little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow
channel between, and some that I couldn&#39;t see I knowed was there because
I&#39;d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash
that hung over the banks.  Well, I warn&#39;t long loosing the whoops down
amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,
anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o&#39;-lantern.  You never
knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.

I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the
raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would
get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little
faster than what I was.

Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn&#39;t
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so I
laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn&#39;t bother no more.  I didn&#39;t
want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn&#39;t help it;
so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.

But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars
was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a
big bend stern first.  First I didn&#39;t know where I was; I thought I was
dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come
up dim out of last week.

It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest
kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see
by the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn&#39;t nothing but a
couple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, and
chased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.

When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  The
other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt.  So she&#39;d had a rough time.

I made fast and laid down under Jim&#39;s nose on the raft, and began to
gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:

&quot;Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn&#39;t you stir me up?&quot;

&quot;Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain&#39; dead--you ain&#39;
drownded--you&#39;s back agin?  It&#39;s too good for true, honey, it&#39;s too good
for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o&#39; you.  No, you ain&#39;
dead! you&#39;s back agin, &#39;live en soun&#39;, jis de same ole Huck--de same ole
Huck, thanks to goodness!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?&quot;

&quot;Drinkin&#39;?  Has I ben a-drinkin&#39;?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?&quot;

&quot;How does I talk wild?&quot;

&quot;_How_?  Why, hain&#39;t you been talking about my coming back, and all that
stuff, as if I&#39;d been gone away?&quot;

&quot;Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain&#39;t_ you
ben gone away?&quot;

&quot;Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain&#39;t been gone
anywheres.  Where would I go to?&quot;

&quot;Well, looky here, boss, dey&#39;s sumf&#39;n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who
_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat&#39;s what I wants to know.&quot;

&quot;Well, I think you&#39;re here, plain enough, but I think you&#39;re a
tangle-headed old fool, Jim.&quot;

&quot;I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn&#39;t you tote out de line in
de canoe fer to make fas&#39; to de tow-head?&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t.  What tow-head?  I hain&#39;t see no tow-head.&quot;

&quot;You hain&#39;t seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn&#39;t de line pull loose en
de raf&#39; go a-hummin&#39; down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in
de fog?&quot;

&quot;What fog?&quot;

&quot;Why, de fog!--de fog dat&#39;s been aroun&#39; all night.  En didn&#39;t you whoop,
en didn&#39;t I whoop, tell we got mix&#39; up in de islands en one un us got
los&#39; en t&#39;other one was jis&#39; as good as los&#39;, &#39;kase he didn&#39; know whah
he wuz? En didn&#39;t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
time en mos&#39; git drownded?  Now ain&#39; dat so, boss--ain&#39;t it so?  You
answer me dat.&quot;

&quot;Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain&#39;t seen no fog, nor no
islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon
I done the same.  You couldn&#39;t a got drunk in that time, so of course
you&#39;ve been dreaming.&quot;

&quot;Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?&quot;

&quot;Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn&#39;t any of it
happen.&quot;

&quot;But, Huck, it&#39;s all jis&#39; as plain to me as--&quot;

&quot;It don&#39;t make no difference how plain it is; there ain&#39;t nothing in it.
I know, because I&#39;ve been here all the time.&quot;

Jim didn&#39;t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying
over it.  Then he says:

&quot;Well, den, I reck&#39;n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain&#39;t
de powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain&#39;t ever had no dream b&#39;fo&#39;
dat&#39;s tired me like dis one.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, that&#39;s all right, because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me all
about it, Jim.&quot;

So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as
it happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he must
start in and &quot;&#39;terpret&quot; it, because it was sent for a warning.  He said
the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but
the current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoops
was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn&#39;t
try hard to make out to understand them they&#39;d just take us into bad
luck, &#39;stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles
we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
folks, but if we minded our business and didn&#39;t talk back and aggravate
them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big
clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn&#39;t have no more
trouble.

It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it
was clearing up again now.

&quot;Oh, well, that&#39;s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,&quot; I
says; &quot;but what does _these_ things stand for?&quot;

It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  You
could see them first-rate now.

Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
again.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
couldn&#39;t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place
again right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around he
looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:

&quot;What do dey stan&#39; for?  I&#39;se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all wore
out wid work, en wid de callin&#39; for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz
mos&#39; broke bekase you wuz los&#39;, en I didn&#39; k&#39;yer no&#39; mo&#39; what become
er me en de raf&#39;.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe
en soun&#39;, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo&#39;
foot, I&#39;s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin&#39; &#39;bout wuz how you could
make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash
is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren&#39;s en makes &#39;em
ashamed.&quot;

Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without
saying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so mean
I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.

It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn&#39;t ever sorry for it
afterwards, neither.  I didn&#39;t do him no more mean tricks, and I
wouldn&#39;t done that one if I&#39;d a knowed it would make him feel that way.




CHAPTER XVI.

WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a
monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had
four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty
men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open
camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a
power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman
on such a craft as that.

We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got
hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on
both sides; you couldn&#39;t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We
talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to
it.  I said likely we wouldn&#39;t, because I had heard say there warn&#39;t but
about a dozen houses there, and if they didn&#39;t happen to have them lit
up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two
big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question
was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
Cairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited.

There warn&#39;t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
not pass it without seeing it.  He said he&#39;d be mighty sure to see it,
because he&#39;d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
he&#39;d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every
little while he jumps up and says:

&quot;Dah she is?&quot;

But it warn&#39;t.  It was Jack-o&#39;-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set
down again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,
because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and
who was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn&#39;t get that out of my
conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn&#39;t
rest; I couldn&#39;t stay still in one place.  It hadn&#39;t ever come home to
me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it
stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to
myself that I warn&#39;t to blame, because I didn&#39;t run Jim off from his
rightful owner; but it warn&#39;t no use, conscience up and says, every
time, &quot;But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a
paddled ashore and told somebody.&quot;  That was so--I couldn&#39;t get around
that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, &quot;What
had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off
right under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor
old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to
learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
be good to you every way she knowed how.  _That&#39;s_ what she done.&quot;

I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  I
fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still.
 Every time he danced around and says, &quot;Dah&#39;s Cairo!&quot; it went through me
like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness.

Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he
got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to
where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the
two children, and if their master wouldn&#39;t sell them, they&#39;d get an
Ab&#39;litionist to go and steal them.

It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn&#39;t ever dared to talk such
talk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,
&quot;Give a nigger an inch and he&#39;ll take an ell.&quot;  Thinks I, this is what
comes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as good
as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would
steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn&#39;t even know; a
man that hadn&#39;t ever done me no harm.

I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  My
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says
to it, &quot;Let up on me--it ain&#39;t too late yet--I&#39;ll paddle ashore at the
first light and tell.&quot;  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a
light, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings
out:

&quot;We&#39;s safe, Huck, we&#39;s safe!  Jump up and crack yo&#39; heels!  Dat&#39;s de
good ole Cairo at las&#39;, I jis knows it!&quot;

I says:

&quot;I&#39;ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn&#39;t be, you know.&quot;

He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:

&quot;Pooty soon I&#39;ll be a-shout&#39;n&#39; for joy, en I&#39;ll say, it&#39;s all on
accounts o&#39; Huck; I&#39;s a free man, en I couldn&#39;t ever ben free ef it
hadn&#39; ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won&#39;t ever forgit you, Huck;
you&#39;s de bes&#39; fren&#39; Jim&#39;s ever had; en you&#39;s de _only_ fren&#39; ole Jim&#39;s
got now.&quot;

I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says
this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went along
slow then, and I warn&#39;t right down certain whether I was glad I started
or whether I warn&#39;t.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:

&quot;Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on&#39;y white genlman dat ever kep&#39; his
promise to ole Jim.&quot;

Well, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can&#39;t get _out_
of it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and
they stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:

&quot;What&#39;s that yonder?&quot;

&quot;A piece of a raft,&quot; I says.

&quot;Do you belong on it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

&quot;Any men on it?&quot;

&quot;Only one, sir.&quot;

&quot;Well, there&#39;s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head
of the bend.  Is your man white or black?&quot;

I didn&#39;t answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn&#39;t come. I
tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn&#39;t man
enough--hadn&#39;t the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I just
give up trying, and up and says:

&quot;He&#39;s white.&quot;

&quot;I reckon we&#39;ll go and see for ourselves.&quot;

&quot;I wish you would,&quot; says I, &quot;because it&#39;s pap that&#39;s there, and maybe
you&#39;d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He&#39;s sick--and so
is mam and Mary Ann.&quot;

&quot;Oh, the devil! we&#39;re in a hurry, boy.  But I s&#39;pose we&#39;ve got to.
 Come, buckle to your paddle, and let&#39;s get along.&quot;

I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made a
stroke or two, I says:

&quot;Pap&#39;ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goes
away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can&#39;t do it
by myself.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what&#39;s the matter
with your father?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the--a--the--well, it ain&#39;t anything much.&quot;

They stopped pulling.  It warn&#39;t but a mighty little ways to the raft
now. One says:

&quot;Boy, that&#39;s a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer up
square now, and it&#39;ll be the better for you.&quot;

&quot;I will, sir, I will, honest--but don&#39;t leave us, please.  It&#39;s
the--the--Gentlemen, if you&#39;ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the
headline, you won&#39;t have to come a-near the raft--please do.&quot;

&quot;Set her back, John, set her back!&quot; says one.  They backed water.  &quot;Keep
away, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind has
blowed it to us.  Your pap&#39;s got the small-pox, and you know it precious
well.  Why didn&#39;t you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all
over?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; says I, a-blubbering, &quot;I&#39;ve told everybody before, and they just
went away and left us.&quot;

&quot;Poor devil, there&#39;s something in that.  We are right down sorry for
you, but we--well, hang it, we don&#39;t want the small-pox, you see.  Look
here, I&#39;ll tell you what to do.  Don&#39;t you try to land by yourself, or
you&#39;ll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty
miles, and you&#39;ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It
will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them
your folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don&#39;t be a fool again,
and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we&#39;re trying to do you a
kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that&#39;s a good boy.
 It wouldn&#39;t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it&#39;s only a
wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father&#39;s poor, and I&#39;m bound to say he&#39;s
in pretty hard luck.  Here, I&#39;ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
board, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave
you; but my kingdom! it won&#39;t do to fool with small-pox, don&#39;t you see?&quot;

&quot;Hold on, Parker,&quot; says the other man, &quot;here&#39;s a twenty to put on the
board for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you&#39;ll
be all right.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggers
you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.&quot;

&quot;Good-bye, sir,&quot; says I; &quot;I won&#39;t let no runaway niggers get by me if I
can help it.&quot;

They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I
knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn&#39;t no use for me
to try to learn to do right; a body that don&#39;t get _started_ right when
he&#39;s little ain&#39;t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain&#39;t nothing
to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I
thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s&#39;pose you&#39;d a done right
and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says
I, I&#39;d feel bad--I&#39;d feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says
I, what&#39;s the use you learning to do right when it&#39;s troublesome to do
right and ain&#39;t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
 I was stuck.  I couldn&#39;t answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn&#39;t bother
no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at
the time.

I went into the wigwam; Jim warn&#39;t there.  I looked all around; he
warn&#39;t anywhere.  I says:

&quot;Jim!&quot;

&quot;Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o&#39; sight yit?  Don&#39;t talk loud.&quot;

He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I told
him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:

&quot;I was a-listenin&#39; to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for sho&#39; if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to de
raf&#39; agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool &#39;em, Huck!
 Dat _wuz_ de smartes&#39; dodge!  I tell you, chile, I&#39;spec it save&#39; ole
Jim--ole Jim ain&#39;t going to forgit you for dat, honey.&quot;

Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty
dollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat
now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
States. He said twenty mile more warn&#39;t far for the raft to go, but he
wished we was already there.

Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and
getting all ready to quit rafting.

That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a left-hand bend.

I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out
in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:

&quot;Mister, is that town Cairo?&quot;

&quot;Cairo? no.  You must be a blame&#39; fool.&quot;

&quot;What town is it, mister?&quot;

&quot;If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin&#39;
around me for about a half a minute longer you&#39;ll get something you
won&#39;t want.&quot;

I paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.

We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but
it was high ground, so I didn&#39;t go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jim
said. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable
close to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did
Jim.  I says:

&quot;Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.&quot;

He says:

&quot;Doan&#39; le&#39;s talk about it, Huck.  Po&#39; niggers can&#39;t have no luck.  I
awluz &#39;spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn&#39;t done wid its work.&quot;

&quot;I wish I&#39;d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I&#39;d never laid
eyes on it.&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t yo&#39; fault, Huck; you didn&#39; know.  Don&#39;t you blame yo&#39;self
&#39;bout it.&quot;

When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure
enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with
Cairo.

We talked it all over.  It wouldn&#39;t do to take to the shore; we couldn&#39;t
take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn&#39;t no way but to wait
for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept
all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,
and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!

We didn&#39;t say a word for a good while.  There warn&#39;t anything to
say.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would only
look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
still.

By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn&#39;t no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
a canoe to go back in.  We warn&#39;t going to borrow it when there warn&#39;t
anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after
us.

So we shoved out after dark on the raft.

Anybody that don&#39;t believe yet that it&#39;s foolishness to handle a
snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
now if they read on and see what more it done for us.

The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we
didn&#39;t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next
meanest thing to fog.  You can&#39;t tell the shape of the river, and you
can&#39;t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along
comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she
would see it.  Up-stream boats didn&#39;t generly come close to us; they
go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.

We could hear her pounding along, but we didn&#39;t see her good till she
was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see
how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
he&#39;s mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to
try and shave us; but she didn&#39;t seem to be sheering off a bit.  She
was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went
overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight
through the raft.

I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel
had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could
always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a
minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was
nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and
of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I
could hear her.

I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn&#39;t get any answer;
so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was &quot;treading water,&quot; and
struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see
that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which
meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.

It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the
bank. I couldn&#39;t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over
rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a
big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to
rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling
and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.




CHAPTER XVII.

IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his
head out, and says:

&quot;Be done, boys!  Who&#39;s there?&quot;

I says:

&quot;It&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s me?&quot;

&quot;George Jackson, sir.&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogs
won&#39;t let me.&quot;

&quot;What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?&quot;

&quot;I warn&#39;t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did you
say your name was?&quot;

&quot;George Jackson, sir.  I&#39;m only a boy.&quot;

&quot;Look here, if you&#39;re telling the truth you needn&#39;t be afraid--nobody&#39;ll
hurt you.  But don&#39;t try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse out
Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there
anybody with you?&quot;

&quot;No, sir, nobody.&quot;

I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
The man sung out:

&quot;Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain&#39;t you got any sense?
Put it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom are
ready, take your places.&quot;

&quot;All ready.&quot;

&quot;Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?&quot;

&quot;No, sir; I never heard of them.&quot;

&quot;Well, that may be so, and it mayn&#39;t.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,
George Jackson.  And mind, don&#39;t you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there&#39;s
anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he&#39;ll be shot.
Come along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to
squeeze in, d&#39; you hear?&quot;

I didn&#39;t hurry; I couldn&#39;t if I&#39;d a wanted to.  I took one slow step at
a time and there warn&#39;t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
 The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
little and a little more till somebody said, &quot;There, that&#39;s enough--put
your head in.&quot; I done it, but I judged they would take it off.

The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and
me at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with guns
pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray
and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and
handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two
young women which I couldn&#39;t see right well.  The old gentleman says:

&quot;There; I reckon it&#39;s all right.  Come in.&quot;

As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and
they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,
and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front
windows--there warn&#39;t none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a
good look at me, and all said, &quot;Why, _he_ ain&#39;t a Shepherdson--no, there
ain&#39;t any Shepherdson about him.&quot;  Then the old man said he hoped I
wouldn&#39;t mind being searched for arms, because he didn&#39;t mean no harm by
it--it was only to make sure.  So he didn&#39;t pry into my pockets, but only
felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to
make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old
lady says:

&quot;Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing&#39;s as wet as he can be; and don&#39;t
you reckon it may be he&#39;s hungry?&quot;

&quot;True for you, Rachel--I forgot.&quot;

So the old lady says:

&quot;Betsy&quot; (this was a nigger woman), &quot;you fly around and get him something
to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake
up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this little
stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some
of yours that&#39;s dry.&quot;

Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,
though he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn&#39;t on anything but a
shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging one
fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.
He says:

&quot;Ain&#39;t they no Shepherdsons around?&quot;

They said, no, &#39;twas a false alarm.

&quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;if they&#39;d a ben some, I reckon I&#39;d a got one.&quot;

They all laughed, and Bob says:

&quot;Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you&#39;ve been so slow in
coming.&quot;

&quot;Well, nobody come after me, and it ain&#39;t right I&#39;m always kept down; I
don&#39;t get no show.&quot;

&quot;Never mind, Buck, my boy,&quot; says the old man, &quot;you&#39;ll have show enough,
all in good time, don&#39;t you fret about that.  Go &#39;long with you now, and
do as your mother told you.&quot;

When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it he
asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to
tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods
day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle
went out.  I said I didn&#39;t know; I hadn&#39;t heard about it before, no way.

&quot;Well, guess,&quot; he says.

&quot;How&#39;m I going to guess,&quot; says I, &quot;when I never heard tell of it
before?&quot;

&quot;But you can guess, can&#39;t you?  It&#39;s just as easy.&quot;

&quot;_Which_ candle?&quot;  I says.

&quot;Why, any candle,&quot; he says.

&quot;I don&#39;t know where he was,&quot; says I; &quot;where was he?&quot;

&quot;Why, he was in the _dark_!  That&#39;s where he was!&quot;

&quot;Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?&quot;

&quot;Why, blame it, it&#39;s a riddle, don&#39;t you see?  Say, how long are you
going to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have booming
times--they don&#39;t have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I&#39;ve got a
dog--and he&#39;ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Do
you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet
I don&#39;t, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon
I&#39;d better put &#39;em on, but I&#39;d ruther not, it&#39;s so warm.  Are you all
ready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.&quot;

Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they
had for me down there, and there ain&#39;t nothing better that ever I&#39;ve
come across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,
except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They
all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had
quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me
questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living
on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann
run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went
to hunt them and he warn&#39;t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
and then there warn&#39;t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
I took what there was left, because the farm didn&#39;t belong to us, and
started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
I come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I
wanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to
think, and when Buck waked up I says:

&quot;Can you spell, Buck?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; he says.

&quot;I bet you can&#39;t spell my name,&quot; says I.

&quot;I bet you what you dare I can,&quot; says he.

&quot;All right,&quot; says I, &quot;go ahead.&quot;

&quot;G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,&quot; he says.

&quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;you done it, but I didn&#39;t think you could.  It ain&#39;t no
slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.&quot;

I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it
next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was
used to it.

It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn&#39;t
seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style.  It didn&#39;t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
town. There warn&#39;t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that
was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by
pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes
they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with
a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and
a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the
pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;
and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her
up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred
and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn&#39;t took any money for
her.

Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,
made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the
parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;
and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn&#39;t open
their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through
underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out
behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind
of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and
grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier
than real ones is, but they warn&#39;t real because you could see where
pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it
was, underneath.

This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and
blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It
come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,
too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a
big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, about a
man that left his family, it didn&#39;t say why.  I read considerable in it
now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was
Friendship&#39;s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn&#39;t
read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay&#39;s Speeches, and another was Dr.
Gunn&#39;s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body
was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And
there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged
down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.

They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,
and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called &quot;Signing the
Declaration.&quot; There was some that they called crayons, which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only
fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see
before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black
dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in
the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with
a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
and underneath the picture it said &quot;Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.&quot;
 Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight
to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a
chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath
the picture it said &quot;I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.&quot;
 There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in
one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
the picture it said &quot;And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.&quot;  These
was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn&#39;t somehow seem to take
to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot
more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done
what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they
said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it
done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman
in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump
off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with
the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up
towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died
before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the
head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung
flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young
woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so
many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.

This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.
It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC&#39;D

And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did the
sad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?

No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad
hearts round him thickened,    &#39;Twas not from sickness&#39; shots.

No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;
Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.

Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Nor
stomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.

O no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul
did from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.

They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spirit
was gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.

If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen, there ain&#39;t no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn&#39;t ever have to
stop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn&#39;t
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one, and go ahead. She warn&#39;t particular; she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.
Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on
hand with her &quot;tribute&quot; before he was cold.  She called them tributes.
The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person&#39;s name, which was
Whistler.  She warn&#39;t ever the same after that; she never complained,
but she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many&#39;s the
time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that
family, dead ones and all, and warn&#39;t going to let anything come between
us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive, and it didn&#39;t seem right that there warn&#39;t nobody to make some
about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself, but I couldn&#39;t seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline&#39;s
room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she
liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
 The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty
of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
mostly.

Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on
the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little
old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing &quot;The Last Link is Broken&quot;
and play &quot;The Battle of Prague&quot; on it.  The walls of all the rooms was
plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside.

It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed
and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the
day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn&#39;t be better.
 And warn&#39;t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!




CHAPTER XVIII.

COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all
over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and
that&#39;s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas
said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn&#39;t no more
quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and
very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and
every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head
to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;
and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He
carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn&#39;t no
frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn&#39;t ever loud.  He was
as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had
confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he
straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to
flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,
and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn&#39;t ever have to
tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered
where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine
most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned
into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was
enough; there wouldn&#39;t nothing go wrong again for a week.

When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got
up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn&#39;t set down again
till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where
the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and
he held it in his hand and waited till Tom&#39;s and Bob&#39;s was mixed, and
then they bowed and said, &quot;Our duty to you, sir, and madam;&quot; and _they_
bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,
all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and
the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.

Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They
dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
wore broad Panama hats.

Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn&#39;t stirred up; but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
like her father.  She was beautiful.

So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was
gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.

Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger
had a monstrous easy time, because I warn&#39;t used to having anybody do
anything for me, but Buck&#39;s was on the jump most of the time.

This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.

The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings
round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods
daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly
kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a
handsome lot of quality, I tell you.

There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six
families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned
and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The
Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was
about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a
lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their
fine horses.

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse
coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:

&quot;Quick!  Jump for the woods!&quot;

We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his
horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his
pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I
heard Buck&#39;s gun go off at my ear, and Harney&#39;s hat tumbled off from his
head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was
hid.  But we didn&#39;t wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The
woods warn&#39;t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,
and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away
the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn&#39;t see.  We never
stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman&#39;s eyes blazed a
minute--&#39;twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed
down, and he says, kind of gentle:

&quot;I don&#39;t like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn&#39;t you step
into the road, my boy?&quot;

&quot;The Shepherdsons don&#39;t, father.  They always take advantage.&quot;

Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young
men looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,
but the color come back when she found the man warn&#39;t hurt.

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by
ourselves, I says:

&quot;Did you want to kill him, Buck?&quot;

&quot;Well, I bet I did.&quot;

&quot;What did he do to you?&quot;

&quot;Him?  He never done nothing to me.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?&quot;

&quot;Why, nothing--only it&#39;s on account of the feud.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a feud?&quot;

&quot;Why, where was you raised?  Don&#39;t you know what a feud is?&quot;

&quot;Never heard of it before--tell me about it.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; says Buck, &quot;a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with
another man, and kills him; then that other man&#39;s brother kills _him_;
then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the
_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody&#39;s killed off, and there ain&#39;t
no more feud.  But it&#39;s kind of slow, and takes a long time.&quot;

&quot;Has this one been going on long, Buck?&quot;

&quot;Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som&#39;ers along
there.  There was trouble &#39;bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle
it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the
man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody
would.&quot;

&quot;What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?&quot;

&quot;I reckon maybe--I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?&quot;

&quot;Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t anybody know?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they
don&#39;t know now what the row was about in the first place.&quot;

&quot;Has there been many killed, Buck?&quot;

&quot;Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don&#39;t always kill.  Pa&#39;s
got a few buckshot in him; but he don&#39;t mind it &#39;cuz he don&#39;t weigh
much, anyway.  Bob&#39;s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom&#39;s been
hurt once or twice.&quot;

&quot;Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?&quot;

&quot;Yes; we got one and they got one.  &#39;Bout three months ago my cousin
Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t&#39;other side
of the river, and didn&#39;t have no weapon with him, which was blame&#39;
foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind
him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin&#39; after him with his gun in
his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and &#39;stead of jumping
off and taking to the brush, Bud &#39;lowed he could out-run him; so they
had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all
the time; so at last Bud seen it warn&#39;t any use, so he stopped and faced
around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old
man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn&#39;t git much chance to
enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.&quot;

&quot;I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.&quot;

&quot;I reckon he _warn&#39;t_ a coward.  Not by a blame&#39; sight.  There ain&#39;t a
coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain&#39;t no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep&#39; up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come
out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
behind a little woodpile, and kep&#39; his horse before him to stop the
bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around
the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.
 Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the
Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of &#39;em was dead, and
another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body&#39;s out hunting for cowards
he don&#39;t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz
they don&#39;t breed any of that _kind_.&quot;

Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The
Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about
brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was
a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such
a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination, and I don&#39;t know what all, that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and
a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up
to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet
Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took
me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,
and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she&#39;d forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,
and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say
nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the
road, and there warn&#39;t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
for there warn&#39;t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
in summer-time because it&#39;s cool.  If you notice, most folks don&#39;t go to
church only when they&#39;ve got to; but a hog is different.

Says I to myself, something&#39;s up; it ain&#39;t natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a
little piece of paper with &quot;HALF-PAST TWO&quot; wrote on it with a pencil.  I
ransacked it, but couldn&#39;t find anything else.  I couldn&#39;t make anything
out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She
pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till
she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was
mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I
had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,
and I told her &quot;no, only coarse-hand,&quot; and then she said the paper
warn&#39;t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and
play now.

I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out
of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
a-running, and says:

&quot;Mars Jawge, if you&#39;ll come down into de swamp I&#39;ll show you a whole
stack o&#39; water-moccasins.&quot;

Thinks I, that&#39;s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter
know a body don&#39;t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for
them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:

&quot;All right; trot ahead.&quot;

I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded
ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,
and he says:

&quot;You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah&#39;s whah dey is.
I&#39;s seed &#39;m befo&#39;; I don&#39;t k&#39;yer to see &#39;em no mo&#39;.&quot;

Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid
him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch
as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying
there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!

I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to
him to see me again, but it warn&#39;t.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but
he warn&#39;t surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard
me yell every time, but dasn&#39;t answer, because he didn&#39;t want nobody to
pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:

&quot;I got hurt a little, en couldn&#39;t swim fas&#39;, so I wuz a considable ways
behine you towards de las&#39;; when you landed I reck&#39;ned I could ketch
up wid you on de lan&#39; &#39;dout havin&#39; to shout at you, but when I see dat
house I begin to go slow.  I &#39;uz off too fur to hear what dey say to
you--I wuz &#39;fraid o&#39; de dogs; but when it &#39;uz all quiet agin I knowed
you&#39;s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.  Early
in de mawnin&#39; some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can&#39;t track me on accounts
o&#39; de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how
you&#39;s a-gitt&#39;n along.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Well, &#39;twarn&#39;t no use to &#39;sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but
we&#39;s all right now.  I ben a-buyin&#39; pots en pans en vittles, as I got a
chanst, en a-patchin&#39; up de raf&#39; nights when--&quot;

&quot;_What_ raft, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Our ole raf&#39;.&quot;

&quot;You mean to say our old raft warn&#39;t smashed all to flinders?&quot;

&quot;No, she warn&#39;t.  She was tore up a good deal--one en&#39; of her was; but
dey warn&#39;t no great harm done, on&#39;y our traps was mos&#39; all los&#39;.  Ef we
hadn&#39; dive&#39; so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn&#39; ben
so dark, en we warn&#39;t so sk&#39;yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin&#39;
is, we&#39;d a seed de raf&#39;.  But it&#39;s jis&#39; as well we didn&#39;t, &#39;kase now
she&#39;s all fixed up agin mos&#39; as good as new, en we&#39;s got a new lot o&#39;
stuff, in de place o&#39; what &#39;uz los&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?&quot;

&quot;How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggers
foun&#39; her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben&#39;, en dey hid her in a
crick &#39;mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin&#39; &#39;bout which un &#39;um
she b&#39;long to de mos&#39; dat I come to heah &#39;bout it pooty soon, so I ups
en settles de trouble by tellin&#39; &#39;um she don&#39;t b&#39;long to none uv um, but
to you en me; en I ast &#39;m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman&#39;s
propaty, en git a hid&#39;n for it?  Den I gin &#39;m ten cents apiece, en dey
&#39;uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo&#39; raf&#39;s &#39;ud come along en
make &#39;m rich agin. Dey&#39;s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever
I wants &#39;m to do fur me I doan&#39; have to ast &#39;m twice, honey.  Dat Jack&#39;s
a good nigger, en pooty smart.&quot;

&quot;Yes, he is.  He ain&#39;t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and
he&#39;d show me a lot of water-moccasins.  If anything happens _he_ ain&#39;t
mixed up in it.  He can say he never seen us together, and it &#39;ll be the
truth.&quot;

I don&#39;t want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I&#39;ll cut it
pretty short.  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and
go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn&#39;t seem to be
anybody stirring.  That warn&#39;t usual.  Next I noticed that Buck was
up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody
around; everything as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  Thinks
I, what does it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and
says:

&quot;What&#39;s it all about?&quot;

Says he:

&quot;Don&#39;t you know, Mars Jawge?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says I, &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Well, den, Miss Sophia&#39;s run off! &#39;deed she has.  She run off in de
night some time--nobody don&#39;t know jis&#39; when; run off to get married
to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey &#39;spec.  De
fambly foun&#39; it out &#39;bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo&#39;--en&#39; I
_tell_ you dey warn&#39;t no time los&#39;.  Sich another hurryin&#39; up guns
en hosses _you_ never see!  De women folks has gone for to stir up de
relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de
river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him &#39;fo&#39; he kin
git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.  I reck&#39;n dey&#39;s gwyne to be mighty
rough times.&quot;

&quot;Buck went off &#39;thout waking me up.&quot;

&quot;Well, I reck&#39;n he _did_!  Dey warn&#39;t gwyne to mix you up in it.
 Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en &#39;lowed he&#39;s gwyne to fetch home a
Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey&#39;ll be plenty un &#39;m dah, I reck&#39;n, en you
bet you he&#39;ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.&quot;

I took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin to
hear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store and
the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees
and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the
forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was a
wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I
was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn&#39;t.

There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at
a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
steamboat landing; but they couldn&#39;t come it.  Every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  The
two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch
both ways.

By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They started
riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady
bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the
run.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.
Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after
them.  They gained on the boys, but it didn&#39;t do no good, the boys had
too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,
and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old.

The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn&#39;t know what
to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awful
surprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the
men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or
other--wouldn&#39;t be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but I
dasn&#39;t come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and &#39;lowed that him and
his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this
day yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
or three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
ambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their
relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him what
was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they&#39;d got across
the river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take
on because he didn&#39;t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I
hain&#39;t ever heard anything like it.

All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they
swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
singing out, &quot;Kill them, kill them!&quot;  It made me so sick I most fell out
of the tree.  I ain&#39;t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make
me sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn&#39;t ever come ashore
that night to see such things.  I ain&#39;t ever going to get shut of
them--lots of times I dream about them.

I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
trouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my
mind I wouldn&#39;t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I
was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and
I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
wouldn&#39;t ever happened.

When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
and got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering
up Buck&#39;s face, for he was mighty good to me.

It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn&#39;t on his island, so I
tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was
gone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn&#39;t get my breath for most
a minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me
says:

&quot;Good lan&#39;! is dat you, honey?  Doan&#39; make no noise.&quot;

It was Jim&#39;s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along the
bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was
so glad to see me.  He says:

&quot;Laws bless you, chile, I &#39;uz right down sho&#39; you&#39;s dead agin.  Jack&#39;s
been heah; he say he reck&#39;n you&#39;s ben shot, kase you didn&#39; come home no
mo&#39;; so I&#39;s jes&#39; dis minute a startin&#39; de raf&#39; down towards de mouf er
de crick, so&#39;s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I&#39;s mighty
glad to git you back again, honey.&quot;

I says:

&quot;All right--that&#39;s mighty good; they won&#39;t find me, and they&#39;ll think
I&#39;ve been killed, and floated down the river--there&#39;s something up there
that &#39;ll help them think so--so don&#39;t you lose no time, Jim, but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.&quot;

I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in
the middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
judged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn&#39;t had a bite to eat
since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain&#39;t nothing in the world so good
when it&#39;s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn&#39;t no home like a
raft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a
raft don&#39;t.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.




CHAPTER XIX.

TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put
in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile
and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as
night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always
in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next
we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool
off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee
deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly
still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs
a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the
water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t&#39;other side; you
couldn&#39;t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more
paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and
warn&#39;t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and
long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or
jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and
by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the
streak that there&#39;s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it
and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off
of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a
log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t&#39;other side of
the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can
throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and
comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell
on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,
because they&#39;ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they
do get pretty rank; and next you&#39;ve got the full day, and everything
smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!

A little smoke couldn&#39;t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off
of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch
the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by
lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and
maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the
other side you couldn&#39;t tell nothing about her only whether she was
a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn&#39;t be
nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next
you&#39;d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it
chopping, because they&#39;re most always doing it on a raft; you&#39;d see the
axe flash and come down--you don&#39;t hear nothing; you see that axe go
up again, and by the time it&#39;s above the man&#39;s head then you hear the
_k&#39;chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we
would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once
there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating
tin pans so the steamboats wouldn&#39;t run over them.  A scow or a
raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn&#39;t see no sign of them; it made
you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
 Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:

&quot;No; spirits wouldn&#39;t say, &#39;Dern the dern fog.&#39;&quot;

Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and
talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,
whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck&#39;s folks made
for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn&#39;t go much on
clothes, nohow.

Sometimes we&#39;d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
It&#39;s lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled
with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he
allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would
have took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_
them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn&#39;t say nothing
against it, because I&#39;ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it
could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them
streak down.  Jim allowed they&#39;d got spoiled and was hove out of the
nest.

Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out
of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her
waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the
raft a bit, and after that you wouldn&#39;t hear nothing for you couldn&#39;t
tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.

After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or
three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.
 These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant
morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.

One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn&#39;t get some
berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out
from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung
out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn&#39;t been doing
nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs
a-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:

&quot;Don&#39;t you do it.  I don&#39;t hear the dogs and horses yet; you&#39;ve got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that&#39;ll throw the dogs
off the scent.&quot;

They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,
and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,
shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn&#39;t
see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got
further and further away all the time, we couldn&#39;t hardly hear them at
all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe.

One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and
a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had
an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.

The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After
breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out
was that these chaps didn&#39;t know one another.

&quot;What got you into trouble?&quot; says the baldhead to t&#39;other chap.

&quot;Well, I&#39;d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and
it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I
stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act
of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and
you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  So
I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_
you. That&#39;s the whole yarn--what&#39;s yourn?

&quot;Well, I&#39;d ben a-running&#39; a little temperance revival thar &#39;bout a week,
and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin&#39; it
mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin&#39; as much as five
or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and
business a-growin&#39; all the time, when somehow or another a little report
got around last night that I had a way of puttin&#39; in my time with a
private jug on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin&#39;, and told
me the people was getherin&#39; on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and
they&#39;d be along pretty soon and give me &#39;bout half an hour&#39;s start,
and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they&#39;d tar
and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn&#39;t wait for no
breakfast--I warn&#39;t hungry.&quot;

&quot;Old man,&quot; said the young one, &quot;I reckon we might double-team it
together; what do you think?&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39;t undisposed.  What&#39;s your line--mainly?&quot;

&quot;Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology
when there&#39;s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;
sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that
comes handy, so it ain&#39;t work.  What&#39;s your lay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.  Layin&#39; on o&#39;
hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I
k&#39;n tell a fortune pretty good when I&#39;ve got somebody along to find out
the facts for me.  Preachin&#39;s my line, too, and workin&#39; camp-meetin&#39;s,
and missionaryin&#39; around.&quot;

Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh
and says:

&quot;Alas!&quot;

&quot;What &#39;re you alassin&#39; about?&quot; says the bald-head.

&quot;To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded
down into such company.&quot;  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye
with a rag.

&quot;Dern your skin, ain&#39;t the company good enough for you?&quot; says the
baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.

&quot;Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it&#39;s as good as I deserve; for who
fetched me so low when I was so high?  I did myself.  I don&#39;t blame
_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don&#39;t blame anybody.  I deserve it
all.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there&#39;s a grave
somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it&#39;s always done, and take
everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can&#39;t take
that. Some day I&#39;ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken
heart will be at rest.&quot;  He went on a-wiping.

&quot;Drot your pore broken heart,&quot; says the baldhead; &quot;what are you heaving
your pore broken heart at _us_ f&#39;r?  _we_ hain&#39;t done nothing.&quot;

&quot;No, I know you haven&#39;t.  I ain&#39;t blaming you, gentlemen.  I brought
myself down--yes, I did it myself.  It&#39;s right I should suffer--perfectly
right--I don&#39;t make any moan.&quot;

&quot;Brought you down from whar?  Whar was you brought down from?&quot;

&quot;Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--&#39;tis
no matter.  The secret of my birth--&quot;

&quot;The secret of your birth!  Do you mean to say--&quot;

&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; says the young man, very solemn, &quot;I will reveal it to you,
for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I am a duke!&quot;

Jim&#39;s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.
Then the baldhead says:  &quot;No! you can&#39;t mean it?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled
to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure
air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father
dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal
descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and
here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised
by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft!&quot;

Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but
he said it warn&#39;t much use, he couldn&#39;t be much comforted; said if we
was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most
anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we
ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say &quot;Your Grace,&quot; or &quot;My Lord,&quot;
or &quot;Your Lordship&quot;--and he wouldn&#39;t mind it if we called him plain
&quot;Bridgewater,&quot; which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for
him he wanted done.

Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood
around and waited on him, and says, &quot;Will yo&#39; Grace have some o&#39; dis or
some o&#39; dat?&quot; and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him.

But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn&#39;t have much to say, and
didn&#39;t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along
in the afternoon, he says:

&quot;Looky here, Bilgewater,&quot; he says, &quot;I&#39;m nation sorry for you, but you
ain&#39;t the only person that&#39;s had troubles like that.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;

&quot;No you ain&#39;t.  You ain&#39;t the only person that&#39;s ben snaked down
wrongfully out&#39;n a high place.&quot;

&quot;Alas!&quot;

&quot;No, you ain&#39;t the only person that&#39;s had a secret of his birth.&quot;  And,
by jings, _he_ begins to cry.

&quot;Hold!  What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Bilgewater, kin I trust you?&quot; says the old man, still sort of sobbing.

&quot;To the bitter death!&quot;  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,
and says, &quot;That secret of your being:  speak!&quot;

&quot;Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!&quot;

You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:

&quot;You are what?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin&#39; at this very moment
on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the
Sixteen and Marry Antonette.&quot;

&quot;You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you&#39;re the late Charlemagne; you must
be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.&quot;

&quot;Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung
these gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you
see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin&#39;, exiled,
trampled-on, and sufferin&#39; rightful King of France.&quot;

Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn&#39;t know hardly what to
do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we&#39;d got him with us, too.
 So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort
_him_. But he said it warn&#39;t no use, nothing but to be dead and done
with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel
easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his
rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him
&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; and waited on him first at meals, and didn&#39;t set down
in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,
and doing this and that and t&#39;other for him, and standing up till he
told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he
got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and
didn&#39;t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,
the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke&#39;s
great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good
deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace
considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the
king says:

&quot;Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer
raft, Bilgewater, and so what&#39;s the use o&#39; your bein&#39; sour?  It &#39;ll only
make things oncomfortable.  It ain&#39;t my fault I warn&#39;t born a duke,
it ain&#39;t your fault you warn&#39;t born a king--so what&#39;s the use to worry?
 Make the best o&#39; things the way you find &#39;em, says I--that&#39;s my motto.
 This ain&#39;t no bad thing that we&#39;ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy
life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le&#39;s all be friends.&quot;

The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took
away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because
it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.

It didn&#39;t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn&#39;t no
kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I
never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it&#39;s the best way;
then you don&#39;t have no quarrels, and don&#39;t get into no trouble.  If they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn&#39;t no objections, &#39;long as
it would keep peace in the family; and it warn&#39;t no use to tell Jim, so
I didn&#39;t tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way.




CHAPTER XX.

THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
running--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:

&quot;Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?&quot;

No, they allowed he wouldn&#39;t.  I had to account for things some way, so
I says:

&quot;My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he &#39;lowed
he&#39;d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who&#39;s got a little
one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was
pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he&#39;d squared up there warn&#39;t
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn&#39;t
enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
 Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we&#39;d go down to Orleans on it.
 Pa&#39;s luck didn&#39;t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of
the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;
Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or
two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in
skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was
a runaway nigger.  We don&#39;t run daytimes no more now; nights they don&#39;t
bother us.&quot;

The duke says:

&quot;Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  I&#39;ll think the thing over--I&#39;ll invent a plan that&#39;ll fix it.
We&#39;ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don&#39;t want to go by
that town yonder in daylight--it mightn&#39;t be healthy.&quot;

Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was
beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see
that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see
what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim&#39;s,
which was a corn-shuck tick; there&#39;s always cobs around about in a shuck
tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry
shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it
makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would
take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn&#39;t.  He says:

&quot;I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a corn-shuck bed warn&#39;t just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace &#39;ll
take the shuck bed yourself.&quot;

Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
the duke says:

&quot;&#39;Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
submit; &#39;tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear
it.&quot;

We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half
a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o&#39;clock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch
below till twelve, but I wouldn&#39;t a turned in anyway if I&#39;d had a bed,
because a body don&#39;t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not
by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every
second or two there&#39;d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half
a mile around, and you&#39;d see the islands looking dusty through the rain,
and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!
bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and
another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,
but I hadn&#39;t any clothes on, and didn&#39;t mind.  We didn&#39;t have no trouble
about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them.

I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,
so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn&#39;t no show for
me; so I laid outside--I didn&#39;t mind the rain, because it was warm, and
the waves warn&#39;t running so high now.  About two they come up again,
though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because
he reckoned they warn&#39;t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.
 He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.

I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by
the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed
I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the
day.

The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him
and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got
tired of it, and allowed they would &quot;lay out a campaign,&quot; as they called
it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of
little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, &quot;The
celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,&quot; would &quot;lecture on the
Science of Phrenology&quot; at such and such a place, on the blank day of
blank, at ten cents admission, and &quot;furnish charts of character at
twenty-five cents apiece.&quot;  The duke said that was _him_.  In another
bill he was the &quot;world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the
Younger, of Drury Lane, London.&quot;  In other bills he had a lot of other
names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with
a &quot;divining-rod,&quot; &quot;dissipating witch spells,&quot; and so on.  By and by he
says:

&quot;But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,
Royalty?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says the king.

&quot;You shall, then, before you&#39;re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,&quot; says
the duke.  &quot;The first good town we come to we&#39;ll hire a hall and do the
sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
How does that strike you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you
see, I don&#39;t know nothing about play-actin&#39;, and hain&#39;t ever seen much
of it.  I was too small when pap used to have &#39;em at the palace.  Do you
reckon you can learn me?&quot;

&quot;Easy!&quot;

&quot;All right.  I&#39;m jist a-freezn&#39; for something fresh, anyway.  Le&#39;s
commence right away.&quot;

So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and
said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.

&quot;But if Juliet&#39;s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goin&#39; to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t you worry; these country jakes won&#39;t ever think of that.
Besides, you know, you&#39;ll be in costume, and that makes all the
difference in the world; Juliet&#39;s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight
before she goes to bed, and she&#39;s got on her night-gown and her ruffled
nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.&quot;

He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t&#39;other chap, and a long white
cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was
satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the
most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same
time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the
king and told him to get his part by heart.

There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,
too, and see if he couldn&#39;t strike something.  We was out of coffee, so
Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.

When we got there there warn&#39;t nobody stirring; streets empty, and
perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn&#39;t too young or
too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the
woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he&#39;d go and work that
camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.

The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;
a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,
littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for
the camp-meeting.

We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most
awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from
twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched
everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep
off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of
watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.

The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was
bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside
slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
for legs. They didn&#39;t have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms
to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;
and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the
young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and
some of the children didn&#39;t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen
shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks
was courting on the sly.

The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined
out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then
he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up
more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some
begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to
preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front
of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his
words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up
his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and
that, shouting, &quot;It&#39;s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon
it and live!&quot;  And people would shout out, &quot;Glory!--A-a-_men_!&quot;  And so
he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:

&quot;Oh, come to the mourners&#39; bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,
sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,
pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that&#39;s worn and
soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite
heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse
is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!&quot;
(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)

And so on.  You couldn&#39;t make out what the preacher said any more, on
account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the
crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners&#39;
bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the
mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and
shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.

Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him
over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and
the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He
told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the
Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to
goodness he&#39;d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for
the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start
right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest
of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could
do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews
in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there
without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced
a pirate he would say to him, &quot;Don&#39;t you thank me, don&#39;t you give me no
credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,
natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher
there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!&quot;

And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody
sings out, &quot;Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!&quot;  Well,
a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, &quot;Let _him_
pass the hat around!&quot;  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.

So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,
and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being
so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the
prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would
up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he
always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to
live in their houses, and said they&#39;d think it was an honor; but he said
as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn&#39;t do no good, and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
work on the pirates.

When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had
fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,
take it all around, it laid over any day he&#39;d ever put in in the
missionarying line.  He said it warn&#39;t no use talking, heathens don&#39;t
amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.

The duke was thinking _he&#39;d_ been doing pretty well till the king come
to show up, but after that he didn&#39;t think so so much.  He had set
up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he
had got in ten dollars&#39; worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
 He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of
his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
&quot;Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart&quot;--and he left that all set
up and ready to print in the paper, and didn&#39;t charge nothing for it.
 Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he&#39;d done a pretty
square day&#39;s work for it.

Then he showed us another little job he&#39;d printed and hadn&#39;t charged
for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with
a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and &quot;$200 reward&quot; under it.  The
reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said
he run away from St. Jacques&#39; plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send
him back he could have the reward and expenses.

&quot;Now,&quot; says the duke, &quot;after to-night we can run in the daytime if we
want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down
to get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,
but it wouldn&#39;t go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much
like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,
as we say on the boards.&quot;

We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn&#39;t be no trouble
about running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke&#39;s work in
the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could
boom right along if we wanted to.

We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
o&#39;clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn&#39;t
hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.

When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:

&quot;Huck, does you reck&#39;n we gwyne to run acrost any mo&#39; kings on dis
trip?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I says, &quot;I reckon not.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;dat&#39;s all right, den.  I doan&#39; mine one er two kings,
but dat&#39;s enough.  Dis one&#39;s powerful drunk, en de duke ain&#39; much
better.&quot;

I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
had so much trouble, he&#39;d forgot it.




CHAPTER XXI.

IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn&#39;t tie up.  The
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after
they&#39;d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good
deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,
and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs
dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went
to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty
good him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to
learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him
sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done
it pretty well; &quot;only,&quot; he says, &quot;you mustn&#39;t bellow out _Romeo_!
that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet&#39;s a dear sweet mere child of
a girl, you know, and she doesn&#39;t bray like a jackass.&quot;

Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out
of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called
himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around
the raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell
overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all
kinds of adventures they&#39;d had in other times along the river.

After dinner the duke says:

&quot;Well, Capet, we&#39;ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so
I guess we&#39;ll add a little more to it.  We want a little something to
answer encores with, anyway.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s onkores, Bilgewater?&quot;

The duke told him, and then says:

&quot;I&#39;ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor&#39;s hornpipe; and
you--well, let me see--oh, I&#39;ve got it--you can do Hamlet&#39;s soliloquy.&quot;

&quot;Hamlet&#39;s which?&quot;

&quot;Hamlet&#39;s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
Ah, it&#39;s sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven&#39;t got
it in the book--I&#39;ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out
from memory.  I&#39;ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call
it back from recollection&#39;s vaults.&quot;

So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible
every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would
squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next
he would sigh, and next he&#39;d let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful
to see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then
he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his
arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,
all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his
chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
 This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it
to the king:

To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of
so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come
to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the
innocent sleep, Great nature&#39;s second course, And makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.
There&#39;s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I
would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The
oppressor&#39;s wrong, the proud man&#39;s contumely, The law&#39;s delay, and the
quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the
night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But
that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,
Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of
resolution, like the poor cat i&#39; the adage, Is sicklied o&#39;er with care.
And all the clouds that lowered o&#39;er our housetops, With this
regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. &#39;Tis a
consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope
not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&amp;mdash;go!

Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when
he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he
would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.

The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
most uncommon lively place, for there warn&#39;t nothing but sword-fighting
and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,
when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight
of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about
three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was
shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took
the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that
place for our show.

We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in
all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave
before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he
hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They
read like this:

Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn&#39;t ever been painted; they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little
gardens around them, but they didn&#39;t seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up
boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out
tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on
at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that
didn&#39;t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences
had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in
Clumbus&#39;s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and
people driving them out.

All the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings in
front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting
on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and
chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery
lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,
but didn&#39;t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,
and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and
used considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loafer
leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands
in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw
of tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all the
time was:

&quot;Gimme a chaw &#39;v tobacker, Hank.&quot;

&quot;Cain&#39;t; I hain&#39;t got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.&quot;

Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain&#39;t got
none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a
chaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;
they say to a fellow, &quot;I wisht you&#39;d len&#39; me a chaw, Jack, I jist this
minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had&quot;--which is a lie pretty
much everytime; it don&#39;t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain&#39;t no
stranger, so he says:

&quot;_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister&#39;s cat&#39;s
grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you&#39;ve awready borry&#39;d off&#39;n me,
Lafe Buckner, then I&#39;ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won&#39;t charge
you no back intrust, nuther.&quot;

&quot;Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you did--&#39;bout six chaws.  You borry&#39;d store tobacker and paid back
nigger-head.&quot;

Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the
natural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don&#39;t generly cut it
off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with
their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in
two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it
when it&#39;s handed back, and says, sarcastic:

&quot;Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.&quot;

All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn&#39;t nothing else _but_
mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,
and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed and
grunted around everywheres.  You&#39;d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs
come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,
where folks had to walk around her, and she&#39;d stretch out and shut her
eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as
happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you&#39;d hear a loafer
sing out, &quot;Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!&quot; and away the sow would go,
squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and
three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the
loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun
and look grateful for the noise.  Then they&#39;d settle back again till
there was a dog fight.  There couldn&#39;t anything wake them up all over,
and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be
putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a
tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.

On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,
and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people
had moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
others, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, but
it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
and back, and back, because the river&#39;s always gnawing at it.

The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the
wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
 Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them
in the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I
seen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:

&quot;Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly
drunk; here he comes, boys!&quot;

All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out
of Boggs.  One of them says:

&quot;Wonder who he&#39;s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he&#39;d a-chawed up all
the men he&#39;s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he&#39;d have
considerable ruputation now.&quot;

Another one says, &quot;I wisht old Boggs &#39;d threaten me, &#39;cuz then I&#39;d know
I warn&#39;t gwyne to die for a thousan&#39; year.&quot;

Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an
Injun, and singing out:

&quot;Cler the track, thar.  I&#39;m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is
a-gwyne to raise.&quot;

He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year
old, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at
him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he&#39;d attend to them and
lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn&#39;t wait now because
he&#39;d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, &quot;Meat
first, and spoon vittles to top off on.&quot;

He see me, and rode up and says:

&quot;Whar&#39;d you come f&#39;m, boy?  You prepared to die?&quot;

Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:

&quot;He don&#39;t mean nothing; he&#39;s always a-carryin&#39; on like that when he&#39;s
drunk.  He&#39;s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,
drunk nor sober.&quot;

Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down
so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:

&quot;Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you&#39;ve swindled.
You&#39;re the houn&#39; I&#39;m after, and I&#39;m a-gwyne to have you, too!&quot;

And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a
heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and
the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,
mighty ca&#39;m and slow--he says:

&quot;I&#39;m tired of this, but I&#39;ll endure it till one o&#39;clock.  Till one
o&#39;clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once
after that time you can&#39;t travel so far but I will find you.&quot;

Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
stirred, and there warn&#39;t no more laughing.  Boggs rode off
blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping
it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
but he wouldn&#39;t; they told him it would be one o&#39;clock in about fifteen
minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn&#39;t
do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down
in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get
a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn&#39;t no use--up the street
he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by
somebody says:

&quot;Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he&#39;ll listen
to her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.&quot;

So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his
horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with
a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.
He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn&#39;t hanging back any, but was
doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:

&quot;Boggs!&quot;

I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with
the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young
girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned
round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men
jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to
a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,
&quot;O Lord, don&#39;t shoot!&quot;  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,
clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards
on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young
girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her
father, crying, and saying, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s killed him, he&#39;s killed him!&quot;  The
crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting, &quot;Back, back! give him air, give him air!&quot;

Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned
around on his heels and walked off.

They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just
the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good
place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They
laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened
another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt
first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a
dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his
breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that
he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from
him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and
very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.

Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people
that had the places wouldn&#39;t give them up, and folks behind them was
saying all the time, &quot;Say, now, you&#39;ve looked enough, you fellows;
&#39;tain&#39;t right and &#39;tain&#39;t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and
never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as
you.&quot;

There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe
there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was
excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,
and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,
stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long
hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a
crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from
one place to t&#39;other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their
heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with
his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had
stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung
out, &quot;Boggs!&quot; and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says
&quot;Bang!&quot; staggered backwards, says &quot;Bang!&quot; again, and fell down flat on
his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;
said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a
dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.

Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a
minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and
snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.




CHAPTER XXII.

THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn&#39;s house, a-whooping and raging like
Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the
mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along
the road was full of women&#39;s heads, and there was nigger boys in every
tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared
most to death.

They swarmed up in front of Sherburn&#39;s palings as thick as they could
jam together, and you couldn&#39;t hear yourself think for the noise.  It
was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out &quot;Tear down the fence! tear
down the fence!&quot;  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and
smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to
roll in like a wave.

Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,
with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly
ca&#39;m and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the
wave sucked back.

Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
out-gaze him, but they couldn&#39;t; they dropped their eyes and looked
sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant
kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread
that&#39;s got sand in it.

Then he says, slow and scornful:

&quot;The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It&#39;s amusing.  The idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you&#39;re brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
_man_?  Why, a _man&#39;s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as
long as it&#39;s daytime and you&#39;re not behind him.

&quot;Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the
South, and I&#39;ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
The average man&#39;s a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men
in the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a
brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other
people--whereas you&#39;re just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don&#39;t your
juries hang murderers?  Because they&#39;re afraid the man&#39;s friends will
shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it&#39;s just what they _would_ do.

&quot;So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a
hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake
is, that you didn&#39;t bring a man with you; that&#39;s one mistake, and the
other is that you didn&#39;t come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You
brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn&#39;t had him
to start you, you&#39;d a taken it out in blowing.

&quot;You didn&#39;t want to come.  The average man don&#39;t like trouble and
danger. _You_ don&#39;t like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a
man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts &#39;Lynch him! lynch him!&#39; you&#39;re
afraid to back down--afraid you&#39;ll be found out to be what you
are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that
half-a-man&#39;s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big
things you&#39;re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that&#39;s
what an army is--a mob; they don&#39;t fight with courage that&#39;s born in
them, but with courage that&#39;s borrowed from their mass, and from their
officers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_
pitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and
go home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching&#39;s going to be done it
will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they&#39;ll
bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your
half-a-man with you&quot;--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
it when he says this.

The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing
off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking
tolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn&#39;t want to.

I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold
piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
there ain&#39;t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from
home and amongst strangers that way.  You can&#39;t be too careful.  I ain&#39;t
opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain&#39;t no other way, but
there ain&#39;t no use in _wasting_ it on them.

It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes
nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and
comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a
lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang
of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of
dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;
I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up
and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and
graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their
heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and
every lady&#39;s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,
and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.

And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one
foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and
more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking
his whip and shouting &quot;Hi!--hi!&quot; and the clown cracking jokes behind
him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her
knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the
other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I
ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and
went just about wild.

Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The
ringmaster couldn&#39;t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever
_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I
couldn&#39;t noway understand. Why, I couldn&#39;t a thought of them in a year.
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to
ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued
and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn&#39;t listen, and the whole show
come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that
stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, &quot;Knock him down! throw him
out!&quot; and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster
he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn&#39;t be no
disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn&#39;t make no more
trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.
 So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute
he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,
with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every
jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing
till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men
could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,
round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging
to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,
and then t&#39;other one on t&#39;other side, and the people just crazy.  It
warn&#39;t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.
 But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire
too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable
as if he warn&#39;t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his
clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up
the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he
was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you
ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to
the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
astonishment.

Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the
sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own
men!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on
to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn&#39;t
a been in that ringmaster&#39;s place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don&#39;t
know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I
never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and
wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.

Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn&#39;t only about twelve
people there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the
time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these
Arkansaw lunkheads couldn&#39;t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted
was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
reckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:




CHAPTER XXIII.

WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and
a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house
was jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn&#39;t hold no more,
the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on
to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,
and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one
that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about
Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
and at last when he&#39;d got everybody&#39;s expectations up high enough, he
rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing
out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a
rainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,
but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and
when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they
roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done
it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it
would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.

Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of
pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it
in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it.

Twenty people sings out:

&quot;What, is it over?  Is that _all_?&quot;

The duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody sings
out, &quot;Sold!&quot; and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them
tragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:

&quot;Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.&quot;  They stopped to listen.  &quot;We are
sold--mighty badly sold.  But we don&#39;t want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk
this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we&#39;ll all be in the
same boat.  Ain&#39;t that sensible?&quot; (&quot;You bet it is!--the jedge is right!&quot;
everybody sings out.) &quot;All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Go
along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.&quot;

Next day you couldn&#39;t hear nothing around that town but how splendid
that show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold this
crowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to the
raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim
and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and
fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.

The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn&#39;t new-comers
this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  I
stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had
his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it
warn&#39;t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the
signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four
of them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various
for me; I couldn&#39;t stand it.  Well, when the place couldn&#39;t hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door
for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after
him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:

&quot;Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you!&quot;

I done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and
still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a
word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the
audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under
the wigwam, and says:

&quot;Well, how&#39;d the old thing pan out this time, duke?&quot;  He hadn&#39;t been
up-town at all.

We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly
laughed their bones loose over the way they&#39;d served them people.  The
duke says:

&quot;Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they&#39;d lay for us the
third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ their
turn, and I&#39;d give something to know how much they&#39;d take for it.  I
_would_ just like to know how they&#39;re putting in their opportunity.
 They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty
provisions.&quot;

Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
three nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
before.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:

&quot;Don&#39;t it s&#39;prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I says, &quot;it don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t it, Huck?&quot;

&quot;Well, it don&#39;t, because it&#39;s in the breed.  I reckon they&#39;re all
alike.&quot;

&quot;But, Huck, dese kings o&#39; ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat&#39;s jist what
dey is; dey&#39;s reglar rapscallions.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as
fur as I can make out.&quot;

&quot;Is dat so?&quot;

&quot;You read about them once--you&#39;ll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this &#39;n
&#39;s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,
and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward
Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,
you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ a
blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs.  &#39;Fetch up Nell Gwynn,&#39; he says.  They fetch her up.
Next morning, &#39;Chop off her head!&#39;  And they chop it off.  &#39;Fetch up
Jane Shore,&#39; he says; and up she comes, Next morning, &#39;Chop off her
head&#39;--and they chop it off.  &#39;Ring up Fair Rosamun.&#39;  Fair Rosamun
answers the bell.  Next morning, &#39;Chop off her head.&#39;  And he made every
one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had
hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a
book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the
case.  You don&#39;t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
of ourn is one of the cleanest I&#39;ve struck in history.  Well, Henry he
takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How
does he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of a
sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks
out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was
_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his
father, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show
up?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S&#39;pose people
left money laying around where he was--what did he do?  He collared it.
 S&#39;pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn&#39;t set
down there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done the
other thing. S&#39;pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn&#39;t shut it
up powerful quick he&#39;d lose a lie every time.  That&#39;s the kind of a bug
Henry was; and if we&#39;d a had him along &#39;stead of our kings he&#39;d a fooled
that town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don&#39;t say that ourn is lambs,
because they ain&#39;t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they
ain&#39;t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,
and you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they&#39;re a mighty
ornery lot. It&#39;s the way they&#39;re raised.&quot;

&quot;But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.&quot;

&quot;Well, they all do, Jim.  We can&#39;t help the way a king smells; history
don&#39;t tell no way.&quot;

&quot;Now de duke, he&#39;s a tolerble likely man in some ways.&quot;

&quot;Yes, a duke&#39;s different.  But not very different.  This one&#39;s
a middling hard lot for a duke.  When he&#39;s drunk there ain&#39;t no
near-sighted man could tell him from a king.&quot;

&quot;Well, anyways, I doan&#39; hanker for no mo&#39; un um, Huck.  Dese is all I
kin stan&#39;.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we&#39;ve got them on our hands, and we
got to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish we
could hear of a country that&#39;s out of kings.&quot;

What was the use to tell Jim these warn&#39;t real kings and dukes?  It
wouldn&#39;t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you
couldn&#39;t tell them from the real kind.

I went to sleep, and Jim didn&#39;t call me when it was my turn.  He often
done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I
didn&#39;t take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was
thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low
and homesick; because he hadn&#39;t ever been away from home before in his
life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for their&#39;n.  It don&#39;t seem natural, but I reckon it&#39;s so.
 He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
was asleep, and saying, &quot;Po&#39; little &#39;Lizabeth! po&#39; little Johnny! it&#39;s
mighty hard; I spec&#39; I ain&#39;t ever gwyne to see you no mo&#39;, no mo&#39;!&quot;  He
was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.

But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
ones; and by and by he says:

&quot;What makes me feel so bad dis time &#39;uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder
on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time
I treat my little &#39;Lizabeth so ornery.  She warn&#39;t on&#39;y &#39;bout fo&#39; year
ole, en she tuck de sk&#39;yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but
she got well, en one day she was a-stannin&#39; aroun&#39;, en I says to her, I
says:

&quot;&#39;Shet de do&#39;.&#39;

&quot;She never done it; jis&#39; stood dah, kiner smilin&#39; up at me.  It make me
mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:

&quot;&#39;Doan&#39; you hear me?  Shet de do&#39;!&#39;

&quot;She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin&#39; up.  I was a-bilin&#39;!  I says:

&quot;&#39;I lay I _make_ you mine!&#39;

&quot;En wid dat I fetch&#39; her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin&#39;.
Den I went into de yuther room, en &#39;uz gone &#39;bout ten minutes; en when
I come back dah was dat do&#39; a-stannin&#39; open _yit_, en dat chile stannin&#39;
mos&#39; right in it, a-lookin&#39; down and mournin&#39;, en de tears runnin&#39; down.
 My, but I _wuz_ mad!  I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis&#39; den--it was a

jis&#39; as loud as I could yell.  _She never budge!_  Oh, Huck, I bust out

 De Lord God Amighty fogive po&#39; ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive
hisself as long&#39;s he live!&#39;  Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb
deef en dumb--en I&#39;d ben a-treat&#39;n her so!&quot;




CHAPTER XXIV.

NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim
he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn&#39;t take but a few
hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to
lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him
all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all
by himself and not tied it wouldn&#39;t look much like he was a runaway
nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay
roped all day, and he&#39;d cipher out some way to get around it.

He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed
Jim up in King Lear&#39;s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a
white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint
and painted Jim&#39;s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,
dull, solid blue, like a man that&#39;s been drownded nine days.  Blamed if
he warn&#39;t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took
and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:

Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.

And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all
over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself
free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop
out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
 Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
wouldn&#39;t wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn&#39;t only look like he was
dead, he looked considerable more than that.

These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn&#39;t be safe, because maybe
the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn&#39;t hit no
project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he&#39;d
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn&#39;t put up
something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
over to t&#39;other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence
to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his&#39;n
on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king&#39;s
duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never
knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he&#39;d take off
his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand
and good and pious that you&#39;d say he had walked right out of the ark,
and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away
up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple
of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:

&quot;Seein&#39; how I&#39;m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,
Huckleberry; we&#39;ll come down to the village on her.&quot;

I didn&#39;t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.
 I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went
scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to
a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
couple of big carpet-bags by him.

&quot;Run her nose in shore,&quot; says the king.  I done it.  &quot;Wher&#39; you bound
for, young man?&quot;

&quot;For the steamboat; going to Orleans.&quot;

&quot;Git aboard,&quot; says the king.  &quot;Hold on a minute, my servant &#39;ll he&#39;p you
with them bags.  Jump out and he&#39;p the gentleman, Adolphus&quot;--meaning me,
I see.

I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was
mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.
He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he&#39;d come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The
young fellow says:

&quot;When I first see you I says to myself, &#39;It&#39;s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he
come mighty near getting here in time.&#39;  But then I says again, &#39;No, I
reckon it ain&#39;t him, or else he wouldn&#39;t be paddling up the river.&#39;  You
_ain&#39;t_ him, are you?&quot;

&quot;No, my name&#39;s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander
Blodgett, I s&#39;pose I must say, as I&#39;m one o&#39; the Lord&#39;s poor servants.
 But still I&#39;m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving
in time, all the same, if he&#39;s missed anything by it--which I hope he
hasn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Well, he don&#39;t miss any property by it, because he&#39;ll get that all
right; but he&#39;s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn&#39;t
mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything
in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing
else all these three weeks; hadn&#39;t seen him since they was boys
together--and hadn&#39;t ever seen his brother William at all--that&#39;s the deef
and dumb one--William ain&#39;t more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and
George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
brother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William&#39;s the
only ones that&#39;s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven&#39;t got here
in time.&quot;

&quot;Did anybody send &#39;em word?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warn&#39;t going to get well this
time. You see, he was pretty old, and George&#39;s g&#39;yirls was too young to
be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he
was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn&#39;t seem
to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and
William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can&#39;t
bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he&#39;d
told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the
property divided up so George&#39;s g&#39;yirls would be all right--for George
didn&#39;t leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put
a pen to.&quot;

&quot;Why do you reckon Harvey don&#39;t come?  Wher&#39; does he live?&quot;

&quot;Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn&#39;t ever been in
this country.  He hasn&#39;t had any too much time--and besides he mightn&#39;t a
got the letter at all, you know.&quot;

&quot;Too bad, too bad he couldn&#39;t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.
You going to Orleans, you say?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but that ain&#39;t only a part of it.  I&#39;m going in a ship, next
Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a pretty long journey.  But it&#39;ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.
Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?&quot;

&quot;Mary Jane&#39;s nineteen, Susan&#39;s fifteen, and Joanna&#39;s about
fourteen--that&#39;s the one that gives herself to good works and has a
hare-lip.&quot;

&quot;Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.&quot;

&quot;Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they
ain&#39;t going to let them come to no harm.  There&#39;s Hobson, the Babtis&#39;
preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,
and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the
widow Bartley, and--well, there&#39;s a lot of them; but these are the ones
that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when
he wrote home; so Harvey &#39;ll know where to look for friends when he gets
here.&quot;

Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn&#39;t inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
Peter&#39;s business--which was a tanner; and about George&#39;s--which was a
carpenter; and about Harvey&#39;s--which was a dissentering minister; and so
on, and so on.  Then he says:

&quot;What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn&#39;t stop
there.  When they&#39;re deep they won&#39;t stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat
will, but this is a St. Louis one.&quot;

&quot;Was Peter Wilks well off?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it&#39;s reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up som&#39;ers.&quot;

&quot;When did you say he died?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say, but it was last night.&quot;

&quot;Funeral to-morrow, likely?&quot;

&quot;Yes, &#39;bout the middle of the day.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s all terrible sad; but we&#39;ve all got to go, one time or
another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we&#39;re all right.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir, it&#39;s the best way.  Ma used to always say that.&quot;

When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:

&quot;Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
carpet-bags.  And if he&#39;s gone over to t&#39;other side, go over there and
git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.&quot;

I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When
I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a
log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had
said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he
tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for
a slouch. I can&#39;t imitate him, and so I ain&#39;t a-going to try to; but he
really done it pretty good.  Then he says:

&quot;How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?&quot;

The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef
and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a
steamboat.

About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,
but they didn&#39;t come from high enough up the river; but at last there
was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went
aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and
said they wouldn&#39;t land us.  But the king was ca&#39;m.  He says:

&quot;If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry &#39;em, can&#39;t it?&quot;

So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:

&quot;Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher&#39; Mr. Peter Wilks lives?&quot; they
give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,
&quot;What d&#39; I tell you?&quot;  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:

&quot;I&#39;m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_
live yesterday evening.&quot;

Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
back, and says:

&quot;Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
it&#39;s too, too hard!&quot;

Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to
the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn&#39;t drop a carpet-bag and
bust out a-crying.  If they warn&#39;t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,
that ever I struck.

Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
his brother&#39;s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on
his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner
like they&#39;d lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything
like it, I&#39;m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
race.




CHAPTER XXV.

THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
their coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows and
dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:

&quot;Is it _them_?&quot;

And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:

&quot;You bet it is.&quot;

When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
three girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but
that don&#39;t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her
face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles
was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for
them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!
 Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again
at last and have such good times.

Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he
looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so
then him and the duke, with a hand across each other&#39;s shoulder, and
t&#39;other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody
dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
people saying &quot;Sh!&quot; and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then
they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
then they put their arms around each other&#39;s necks, and hung their chins
over each other&#39;s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,
I never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody
was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything
like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t&#39;other on
t&#39;other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the
coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it come
to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,
too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a
word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running
down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give
the next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.

Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and
works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and
flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother
to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long
journey of four thousand mile, but it&#39;s a trial that&#39;s sweetened and
sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother&#39;s heart, because out
of their mouths they can&#39;t, words being too weak and cold, and all that
kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying
fit to bust.

And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the
crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their
might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church
letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and
hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and
bully.

Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the
family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up
with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying
yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that
was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will
name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon
Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and
Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.

Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t&#39;other
world, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away up
to Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;
and then they shook hands with the duke and didn&#39;t say nothing, but just
kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst
he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said &quot;Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo&quot;
all the time, like a baby that can&#39;t talk.

So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty
much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts
of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to
George&#39;s family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote him
the things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out of
that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.

Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-house
and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and
land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold
to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar.  So these two frauds said they&#39;d go and fetch it up, and have
everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
 We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag
they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
yaller-boys.  My, the way the king&#39;s eyes did shine!  He slaps the duke
on the shoulder and says:

&quot;Oh, _this_ ain&#39;t bully nor noth&#39;n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,
_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don&#39;t_ it?&quot;

The duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
king says:

&quot;It ain&#39;t no use talkin&#39;; bein&#39; brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs that&#39;s got left is the line for you and
me, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust&#39;n to Providence.  It&#39;s the best
way, in the long run.  I&#39;ve tried &#39;em all, and ther&#39; ain&#39;t no better
way.&quot;

Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on
trust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:

&quot;Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars?&quot;

They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Then
the duke says:

&quot;Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon
that&#39;s the way of it.  The best way&#39;s to let it go, and keep still about
it.  We can spare it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don&#39;t k&#39;yer noth&#39;n &#39;bout
that--it&#39;s the _count_ I&#39;m thinkin&#39; about.  We want to be awful square
and open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yer
money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther&#39; ain&#39;t noth&#39;n
suspicious.  But when the dead man says ther&#39;s six thous&#39;n dollars, you
know, we don&#39;t want to--&quot;

&quot;Hold on,&quot; says the duke.  &quot;Le&#39;s make up the deffisit,&quot; and he begun to
haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.

&quot;It&#39;s a most amaz&#39;n&#39; good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin&#39; clever
head on you,&quot; says the king.  &quot;Blest if the old Nonesuch ain&#39;t a heppin&#39;
us out agin,&quot; and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them
up.

It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.

&quot;Say,&quot; says the duke, &quot;I got another idea.  Le&#39;s go up stairs and count
this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.&quot;

&quot;Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It&#39;s the most dazzling idea &#39;at ever a
man struck.  You have cert&#39;nly got the most astonishin&#39; head I ever see.
Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther&#39; ain&#39;t no mistake &#39;bout it.  Let &#39;em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this &#39;ll lay &#39;em out.&quot;

When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king
he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty
elegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their
chops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech.  He says:

&quot;Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
them that&#39;s left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by
these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that&#39;s left
fatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done _more_ generous by &#39;em if he hadn&#39;t ben afeard o&#39; woundin&#39;
his dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn&#39;t_ he?  Ther&#39; ain&#39;t no question
&#39;bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o&#39; brothers would it be
that &#39;d stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o&#39; uncles would
it be that &#39;d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these &#39;at he loved
so at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I&#39;ll
jest ask him.&quot; He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to
the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,
and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,
&quot;I knowed it; I reckon _that &#39;ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels
about it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it
_all_.  It&#39;s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.&quot;

Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the
duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  And
everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the
hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:

&quot;You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!&quot;

Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and
before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he&#39;d
started in on--

&quot;--they bein&#39; partickler friends o&#39; the diseased.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re
invited here this evenin&#39;; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;
for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it&#39;s fitten that
his funeral orgies sh&#39;d be public.&quot;

And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
he couldn&#39;t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
&quot;_Obsequies_, you old fool,&quot; and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
reaching it over people&#39;s heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts
it in his pocket, and says:

&quot;Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart&#39;s_ aluz right.  Asks me
to invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make &#39;em all
welcome.  But he needn&#39;t a worried--it was jest what I was at.&quot;

Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca&#39;m, and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  And
when he done it the third time he says:

&quot;I say orgies, not because it&#39;s the common term, because it
ain&#39;t--obsequies bein&#39; the common term--but because orgies is the right
term. Obsequies ain&#39;t used in England no more now--it&#39;s gone out.  We
say orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing
you&#39;re after more exact.  It&#39;s a word that&#39;s made up out&#39;n the Greek
_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover
up; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
funeral.&quot;

He was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
right in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, &quot;Why,
_doctor_!&quot; and Abner Shackleford says:

&quot;Why, Robinson, hain&#39;t you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.&quot;

The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:

&quot;Is it my poor brother&#39;s dear good friend and physician?  I--&quot;

&quot;Keep your hands off of me!&quot; says the doctor.  &quot;_You_ talk like an
Englishman, _don&#39;t_ you?  It&#39;s the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_
Peter Wilks&#39;s brother!  You&#39;re a fraud, that&#39;s what you are!&quot;

Well, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey &#39;d
showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,
and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt
Harvey&#39;s feelings and the poor girl&#39;s feelings, and all that.  But it
warn&#39;t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended
to be an Englishman and couldn&#39;t imitate the lingo no better than what
he did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king
and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  He
says:

&quot;I was your father&#39;s friend, and I&#39;m your friend; and I warn you as a
friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
as he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here
with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
foolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, you
know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listen
to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?&quot;

Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  She
says:

&quot;_Here_ is my answer.&quot;  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
king&#39;s hands, and says, &quot;Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to, and don&#39;t give us no receipt for
it.&quot;

Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
hare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud.  The doctor says:

&quot;All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that a
time &#39;s coming when you&#39;re going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day.&quot; And away he went.

&quot;All right, doctor,&quot; says the king, kinder mocking him; &quot;we&#39;ll try and
get &#39;em to send for you;&quot; which made them all laugh, and they said it
was a prime good hit.




CHAPTER XXVI.

WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
Uncle William, and she&#39;d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was
a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.

So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was
plain but nice.  She said she&#39;d have her frocks and a lot of other traps
took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey&#39;s way, but he said
they warn&#39;t.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was
a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an
old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
with.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings, and so don&#39;t disturb them.  The duke&#39;s room was pretty
small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.

That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
and I stood behind the king and the duke&#39;s chairs and waited on them,
and the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of
the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits
was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to
force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,
and said so--said &quot;How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?&quot; and
&quot;Where, for the land&#39;s sake, _did_ you get these amaz&#39;n pickles?&quot; and
all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a
supper, you know.

And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
if I didn&#39;t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:

&quot;Did you ever see the king?&quot;

&quot;Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.&quot;  I
knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says he
goes to our church, she says:

&quot;What--regular?&quot;

&quot;Yes--regular.  His pew&#39;s right over opposite ourn--on t&#39;other side the
pulpit.&quot;

&quot;I thought he lived in London?&quot;

&quot;Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?&quot;

&quot;But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?&quot;

I see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:

&quot;I mean he goes to our church regular when he&#39;s in Sheffield.  That&#39;s
only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.&quot;

&quot;Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain&#39;t on the sea.&quot;

&quot;Well, who said it was?&quot;

&quot;Why, you did.&quot;

&quot;I _didn&#39;t_ nuther.&quot;

&quot;You did!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You did.&quot;

&quot;I never said nothing of the kind.&quot;

&quot;Well, what _did_ you say, then?&quot;

&quot;Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that&#39;s what I said.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, how&#39;s he going to take the sea baths if it ain&#39;t on the
sea?&quot;

&quot;Looky here,&quot; I says; &quot;did you ever see any Congress-water?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?&quot;

&quot;Why, no.&quot;

&quot;Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath.&quot;

&quot;How does he get it, then?&quot;

&quot;Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  There
in the palace at Sheffield they&#39;ve got furnaces, and he wants his water
hot.  They can&#39;t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.
They haven&#39;t got no conveniences for it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and saved
time.&quot;

When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
comfortable and glad.  Next, she says:

&quot;Do you go to church, too?&quot;

&quot;Yes--regular.&quot;

&quot;Where do you set?&quot;

&quot;Why, in our pew.&quot;

&quot;_Whose_ pew?&quot;

&quot;Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;His&#39;n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?&quot;

&quot;Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?&quot;

&quot;Why, I thought he&#39;d be in the pulpit.&quot;

Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so I
played another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:

&quot;Blame it, do you suppose there ain&#39;t but one preacher to a church?&quot;

&quot;Why, what do they want with more?&quot;

&quot;What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.
They don&#39;t have no less than seventeen.&quot;

&quot;Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn&#39;t set out such a string as that,
not if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take &#39;em a week.&quot;

&quot;Shucks, they don&#39;t _all_ of &#39;em preach the same day--only _one_ of &#39;em.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what does the rest of &#39;em do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or
another.  But mainly they don&#39;t do nothing.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what are they _for_?&quot;

&quot;Why, they&#39;re for _style_.  Don&#39;t you know nothing?&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How is
servants treated in England?  Do they treat &#39;em better &#39;n we treat our
niggers?&quot;

&quot;_No_!  A servant ain&#39;t nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t they give &#39;em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year&#39;s
week, and Fourth of July?&quot;

&quot;Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain&#39;t ever been to England
by that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year&#39;s
end to year&#39;s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger
shows, nor nowheres.&quot;

&quot;Nor church?&quot;

&quot;Nor church.&quot;

&quot;But _you_ always went to church.&quot;

Well, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man&#39;s servant.  But
next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he
wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
law.  But I didn&#39;t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
warn&#39;t satisfied.  She says:

&quot;Honest injun, now, hain&#39;t you been telling me a lot of lies?&quot;

&quot;Honest injun,&quot; says I.

&quot;None of it at all?&quot;

&quot;None of it at all.  Not a lie in it,&quot; says I.

&quot;Lay your hand on this book and say it.&quot;

I see it warn&#39;t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and
said it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:

&quot;Well, then, I&#39;ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I&#39;ll
believe the rest.&quot;

&quot;What is it you won&#39;t believe, Joe?&quot; says Mary Jane, stepping in with
Susan behind her.  &quot;It ain&#39;t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,
and him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be
treated so?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before
they&#39;re hurt.  I hain&#39;t done nothing to him.  He&#39;s told some stretchers,
I reckon, and I said I wouldn&#39;t swallow it all; and that&#39;s every bit
and grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,
can&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care whether &#39;twas little or whether &#39;twas big; he&#39;s here in
our house and a stranger, and it wasn&#39;t good of you to say it.  If you
was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn&#39;t to
say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mam, he said--&quot;

&quot;It don&#39;t make no difference what he _said_--that ain&#39;t the thing.  The
thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make
him remember he ain&#39;t in his own country and amongst his own folks.&quot;

I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I&#39;m letting that old reptile rob
her of her money!

Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you&#39;ll believe me, she did give
Hare-lip hark from the tomb!

Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I&#39;m letting him rob her
of her money!

Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn&#39;t hardly
anything left o&#39; poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.

&quot;All right, then,&quot; says the other girls; &quot;you just ask his pardon.&quot;

She done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautiful
it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so
she could do it again.

I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I&#39;m letting him rob her of
her money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves
out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt so
ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind&#39;s made up;
I&#39;ll hive that money for them or bust.

So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When
I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,
shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that
won&#39;t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would
make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I
dasn&#39;t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they&#39;ve got the
money, and they&#39;d slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to
fetch in help I&#39;d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,
I judge.  No; there ain&#39;t no good way but one.  I got to steal that
money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won&#39;t suspicion
that I done it. They&#39;ve got a good thing here, and they ain&#39;t a-going
to leave till they&#39;ve played this family and this town for all they&#39;re
worth, so I&#39;ll find a chance time enough. I&#39;ll steal it and hide it; and
by and by, when I&#39;m away down the river, I&#39;ll write a letter and tell
Mary Jane where it&#39;s hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,
because the doctor maybe hasn&#39;t let up as much as he lets on he has; he
might scare them out of here yet.

So, thinks I, I&#39;ll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was
dark, but I found the duke&#39;s room, and started to paw around it with
my hands; but I recollected it wouldn&#39;t be much like the king to let
anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to
his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn&#39;t do nothing
without a candle, and I dasn&#39;t light one, of course.  So I judged I&#39;d
got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time
I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I
reached for it, but it wasn&#39;t where I thought it would be; but I touched
the curtain that hid Mary Jane&#39;s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and
snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.

They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn&#39;t found the bed
when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it&#39;s kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and
the king says:

&quot;Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin&#39; short, because it&#39;s better for
us to be down there a-whoopin&#39; up the mournin&#39; than up here givin&#39; &#39;em a
chance to talk us over.&quot;

&quot;Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain&#39;t easy; I ain&#39;t comfortable.  That
doctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I&#39;ve got a
notion, and I think it&#39;s a sound one.&quot;

&quot;What is it, duke?&quot;

&quot;That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip
it down the river with what we&#39;ve got.  Specially, seeing we got it so
easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back.  I&#39;m for knocking off and
lighting out.&quot;

That made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been
a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
king rips out and says:

&quot;What!  And not sell out the rest o&#39; the property?  March off like
a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous&#39;n&#39; dollars&#39; worth o&#39;
property layin&#39; around jest sufferin&#39; to be scooped in?--and all good,
salable stuff, too.&quot;

The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn&#39;t
want to go no deeper--didn&#39;t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_
they had.

&quot;Why, how you talk!&quot; says the king.  &quot;We sha&#39;n&#39;t rob &#39;em of nothing at
all but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is the
suff&#39;rers; because as soon &#39;s it&#39;s found out &#39;at we didn&#39;t own it--which
won&#39;t be long after we&#39;ve slid--the sale won&#39;t be valid, and it &#39;ll all
go back to the estate.  These yer orphans &#39;ll git their house back agin,
and that&#39;s enough for _them_; they&#39;re young and spry, and k&#39;n easy
earn a livin&#39;.  _they_ ain&#39;t a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there&#39;s
thous&#39;n&#39;s and thous&#39;n&#39;s that ain&#39;t nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_
ain&#39;t got noth&#39;n&#39; to complain of.&quot;

Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
doctor hanging over them.  But the king says:

&quot;Cuss the doctor!  What do we k&#39;yer for _him_?  Hain&#39;t we got all the
fools in town on our side?  And ain&#39;t that a big enough majority in any
town?&quot;

So they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:

&quot;I don&#39;t think we put that money in a good place.&quot;

That cheered me up.  I&#39;d begun to think I warn&#39;t going to get a hint of
no kind to help me.  The king says:

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because Mary Jane &#39;ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds
up and put &#39;em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and
not borrow some of it?&quot;

&quot;Your head&#39;s level agin, duke,&quot; says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
I&#39;d better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag before
I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned
I was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw
tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two
amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only
makes up the feather-bed, and don&#39;t turn over the straw tick only about
twice a year, and so it warn&#39;t in no danger of getting stole now.

But I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-way
down stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
could get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside
of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,
with my clothes all on; but I couldn&#39;t a gone to sleep if I&#39;d a wanted
to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by I
heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid
with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was
going to happen.  But nothing did.

So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn&#39;t
begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.




CHAPTER XXVII.

I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed
along, and got down stairs all right.  There warn&#39;t a sound anywheres.
 I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that
was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door
was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a
candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but
I see there warn&#39;t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn&#39;t there.
 Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I
run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I
see to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about
a foot, showing the dead man&#39;s face down in there, with a wet cloth over
it, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just
down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was
so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.

The person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and
kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see
she begun to cry, though I couldn&#39;t hear her, and her back was to me.  I
slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I&#39;d make sure them
watchers hadn&#39;t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything
was all right.  They hadn&#39;t stirred.

I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain&#39;t the
thing that&#39;s going to happen; the thing that&#39;s going to happen is, the
money &#39;ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king
&#39;ll get it again, and it &#39;ll be a long day before he gives anybody
another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide
down and get it out of there, but I dasn&#39;t try it.  Every minute it was
getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin
to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my
hands that nobody hadn&#39;t hired me to take care of.  I don&#39;t wish to be
mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.

When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
watchers was gone.  There warn&#39;t nobody around but the family and the
widow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening, but I couldn&#39;t tell.

Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till
the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin
lid was the way it was before, but I dasn&#39;t go to look in under it, with
folks around.

Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took
seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour
the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the
dead man&#39;s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was
all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding
handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a
little.  There warn&#39;t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on
the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a
funeral than they do at other places except church.

When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his
black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last
touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,
and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people
around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done
it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over
against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever
see; and there warn&#39;t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.

They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready
a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one
that had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson
opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only
one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right
along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you
couldn&#39;t hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody
didn&#39;t seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that
long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry--just depend on me.&quot;  Then he stooped down and begun
to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people&#39;s
heads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and
more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two
sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds
we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker&#39;s
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his
mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,
over the people&#39;s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, &quot;_He
had a rat_!&quot;  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to
his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don&#39;t
cost nothing, and it&#39;s just the little things that makes a man to be
looked up to and liked.  There warn&#39;t no more popular man in town than
what that undertaker was.

Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and
at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him
pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as
soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I
didn&#39;t know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s&#39;pose
somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether
to write to Mary Jane or not? S&#39;pose she dug him up and didn&#39;t find
nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
hunted up and jailed; I&#39;d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
all; the thing&#39;s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I&#39;ve worsened it
a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I&#39;d just let it alone, dad fetch
the whole business!

They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces
again--I couldn&#39;t help it, and I couldn&#39;t rest easy.  But nothing come of
it; the faces didn&#39;t tell me nothing.

The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,
and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was
very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn&#39;t be done.  And he
said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them
poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn&#39;t see no safe way for me to
chip in and change the general tune.

Well, blamed if the king didn&#39;t bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.

So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls&#39; joy
got the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
mother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each
other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls
said they hadn&#39;t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold
away from the town.  I can&#39;t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of
them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other&#39;s necks
and crying; and I reckon I couldn&#39;t a stood it all, but would a had
to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn&#39;t knowed the sale warn&#39;t no
account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.

The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell
you the duke was powerful uneasy.

Next day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
that there was trouble.  The king says:

&quot;Was you in my room night before last?&quot;

&quot;No, your majesty&quot;--which was the way I always called him when nobody but
our gang warn&#39;t around.

&quot;Was you in there yisterday er last night?&quot;

&quot;No, your majesty.&quot;

&quot;Honor bright, now--no lies.&quot;

&quot;Honor bright, your majesty, I&#39;m telling you the truth.  I hain&#39;t been
a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed
it to you.&quot;

The duke says:

&quot;Have you seen anybody else go in there?&quot;

&quot;No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.&quot;

&quot;Stop and think.&quot;

I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:

&quot;Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.&quot;

Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn&#39;t ever
expected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:

&quot;What, all of them?&quot;

&quot;No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don&#39;t think I ever see them
all come _out_ at once but just one time.&quot;

&quot;Hello!  When was that?&quot;

&quot;It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn&#39;t early,
because I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see
them.&quot;

&quot;Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How&#39;d they act?&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t do nothing.  And they didn&#39;t act anyway much, as fur as I
see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they&#39;d shoved in
there to do up your majesty&#39;s room, or something, s&#39;posing you was up;
and found you _warn&#39;t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the
way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn&#39;t already waked you
up.&quot;

&quot;Great guns, _this_ is a go!&quot; says the king; and both of them looked
pretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and
scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a
little raspy chuckle, and says:

&quot;It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on
to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they
_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don&#39;t ever tell _me_
any more that a nigger ain&#39;t got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way
they played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there&#39;s
a fortune in &#39;em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn&#39;t want a
better lay-out than that--and here we&#39;ve gone and sold &#39;em for a song.
 Yes, and ain&#39;t privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that
song--that draft?&quot;

&quot;In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?&quot;

&quot;Well, _that&#39;s_ all right then, thank goodness.&quot;

Says I, kind of timid-like:

&quot;Is something gone wrong?&quot;

The king whirls on me and rips out:

&quot;None o&#39; your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y&#39;r own
affairs--if you got any.  Long as you&#39;re in this town don&#39;t you forgit
_that_--you hear?&quot;  Then he says to the duke, &quot;We got to jest swaller it
and say noth&#39;n&#39;:  mum&#39;s the word for _us_.&quot;

As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and
says:

&quot;Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It&#39;s a good business--yes.&quot;

The king snarls around on him and says:

&quot;I was trying to do for the best in sellin&#39; &#39;em out so quick.  If the
profits has turned out to be none, lackin&#39; considable, and none to
carry, is it my fault any more&#39;n it&#39;s yourn?&quot;

&quot;Well, _they&#39;d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn&#39;t_ if I could a got
my advice listened to.&quot;

The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped
around and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not
coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting
that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then
waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not
laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he&#39;d be
blamed if he&#39;d ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt
dreadful glad I&#39;d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn&#39;t
done the niggers no harm by it.




CHAPTER XXVIII.

BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started
for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls&#39; room the door was open, and
I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she&#39;d
been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she
had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her
hands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I
went in there and says:

&quot;Miss Mary Jane, you can&#39;t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I
can&#39;t--most always.  Tell me about it.&quot;

So she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said
the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn&#39;t
know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and
the children warn&#39;t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted
out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:

&quot;Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain&#39;t _ever_ going to see each other any
more!&quot;

&quot;But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!&quot; says I.

Laws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it
_again_, say it _again_!

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close
place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very
impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
eased-up, like a person that&#39;s had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to
studying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells
the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,
though I ain&#39;t had no experience, and can&#39;t say for certain; but it
looks so to me, anyway; and yet here&#39;s a case where I&#39;m blest if it
don&#39;t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.
 I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it&#39;s
so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I
says to myself at last, I&#39;m a-going to chance it; I&#39;ll up and tell the
truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of
powder and touching it off just to see where you&#39;ll go to. Then I says:

&quot;Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days?&quot;

&quot;Yes; Mr. Lothrop&#39;s.  Why?&quot;

&quot;Never mind why yet.  If I&#39;ll tell you how I know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how
I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop&#39;s and stay four days?&quot;

&quot;Four days!&quot; she says; &quot;I&#39;ll stay a year!&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; I says, &quot;I don&#39;t want nothing more out of _you_ than just
your word--I druther have it than another man&#39;s kiss-the-Bible.&quot;  She
smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind it,
I&#39;ll shut the door--and bolt it.&quot;

Then I come back and set down again, and says:

&quot;Don&#39;t you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to
tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it&#39;s a
bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain&#39;t no help for
it.  These uncles of yourn ain&#39;t no uncles at all; they&#39;re a couple of
frauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we&#39;re over the worst of it, you
can stand the rest middling easy.&quot;

It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she
flung herself on to the king&#39;s breast at the front door and he kissed
her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face
afire like sunset, and says:

&quot;The brute!  Come, don&#39;t waste a minute--not a _second_--we&#39;ll have them
tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!&quot;

Says I:

&quot;Cert&#39;nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop&#39;s, or--&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she says, &quot;what am I _thinking_ about!&quot; she says, and set right
down again.  &quot;Don&#39;t mind what I said--please don&#39;t--you _won&#39;t,_ now,
_will_ you?&quot; Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that
I said I would die first.  &quot;I never thought, I was so stirred up,&quot; she
says; &quot;now go on, and I won&#39;t do so any more.  You tell me what to do,
and whatever you say I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;it&#39;s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I&#39;m fixed so
I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I
druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws, and I&#39;d be all right; but there&#39;d be another
person that you don&#39;t know about who&#39;d be in big trouble.  Well, we
got to save _him_, hain&#39;t we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won&#39;t blow on
them.&quot;

Saying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I could
get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
But I didn&#39;t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me; so I didn&#39;t want the plan to begin working
till pretty late to-night.  I says:

&quot;Miss Mary Jane, I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;ll do, and you won&#39;t have to stay
at Mr. Lothrop&#39;s so long, nuther.  How fur is it?&quot;

&quot;A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.&quot;

&quot;Well, that &#39;ll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay low
till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home
again--tell them you&#39;ve thought of something.  If you get here before
eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don&#39;t turn up wait _till_
eleven, and _then_ if I don&#39;t turn up it means I&#39;m gone, and out of the
way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get
these beats jailed.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;And if it just happens so that I don&#39;t get away, but get took up along
with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,
and you must stand by me all you can.&quot;

&quot;Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha&#39;n&#39;t touch a hair of your head!&quot;
she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it, too.

&quot;If I get away I sha&#39;n&#39;t be here,&quot; I says, &quot;to prove these rapscallions
ain&#39;t your uncles, and I couldn&#39;t do it if I _was_ here.  I could swear
they was beats and bummers, that&#39;s all, though that&#39;s worth something.
Well, there&#39;s others can do that better than what I can, and they&#39;re
people that ain&#39;t going to be doubted as quick as I&#39;d be.  I&#39;ll tell you
how to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--&#39;Royal
Nonesuch, Bricksville.&#39;  Put it away, and don&#39;t lose it.  When the
court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
Bricksville and say they&#39;ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
and ask for some witnesses--why, you&#39;ll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they&#39;ll come a-biling, too.&quot;

I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:

&quot;Just let the auction go right along, and don&#39;t worry.  Nobody don&#39;t
have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction
on accounts of the short notice, and they ain&#39;t going out of this till
they get that money; and the way we&#39;ve fixed it the sale ain&#39;t going to
count, and they ain&#39;t going to get no money.  It&#39;s just like the way
it was with the niggers--it warn&#39;t no sale, and the niggers will be
back before long.  Why, they can&#39;t collect the money for the _niggers_
yet--they&#39;re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;ll run down to breakfast now, and then I&#39;ll start
straight for Mr. Lothrop&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Deed, _that_ ain&#39;t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,&quot; I says, &quot;by no manner
of means; go _before_ breakfast.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?&quot;

&quot;Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don&#39;t know.  What was it?&quot;

&quot;Why, it&#39;s because you ain&#39;t one of these leather-face people.  I don&#39;t
want no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and
read it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your
uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--&quot;

&quot;There, there, don&#39;t!  Yes, I&#39;ll go before breakfast--I&#39;ll be glad to.
And leave my sisters with them?&quot;

&quot;Yes; never mind about them.  They&#39;ve got to stand it yet a while.  They
might suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don&#39;t want you to
see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was
to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.
 No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I&#39;ll fix it with all of
them. I&#39;ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say
you&#39;ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or
to see a friend, and you&#39;ll be back to-night or early in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won&#39;t have my love given to
them.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, it sha&#39;n&#39;t be.&quot;  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no
harm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it&#39;s
the little things that smooths people&#39;s roads the most, down here below;
it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn&#39;t cost nothing.  Then
I says:  &quot;There&#39;s one more thing--that bag of money.&quot;

&quot;Well, they&#39;ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think
_how_ they got it.&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re out, there.  They hain&#39;t got it.&quot;

&quot;Why, who&#39;s got it?&quot;

&quot;I wish I knowed, but I don&#39;t.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from
them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I&#39;m
afraid it ain&#39;t there no more.  I&#39;m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I&#39;m
just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I
come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I
come to, and run--and it warn&#39;t a good place.&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop blaming yourself--it&#39;s too bad to do it, and I won&#39;t allow
it--you couldn&#39;t help it; it wasn&#39;t your fault.  Where did you hide it?&quot;

I didn&#39;t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
couldn&#39;t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So
for a minute I didn&#39;t say nothing; then I says:

&quot;I&#39;d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don&#39;t
mind letting me off; but I&#39;ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and
you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop&#39;s, if you want to.  Do you
reckon that &#39;ll do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;

So I wrote:  &quot;I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was
crying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was
mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.&quot;

It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it
to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the
hand, hard, and says:

&quot;_Good_-bye.  I&#39;m going to do everything just as you&#39;ve told me; and if
I don&#39;t ever see you again, I sha&#39;n&#39;t ever forget you and I&#39;ll think of
you a many and a many a time, and I&#39;ll _pray_ for you, too!&quot;--and she was
gone.

Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she&#39;d take a job that was more
nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that
kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there
warn&#39;t no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
my opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it
ain&#39;t no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she
lays over them all.  I hain&#39;t ever seen her since that time that I see
her go out of that door; no, I hain&#39;t ever seen her since, but I reckon
I&#39;ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
she would pray for me; and if ever I&#39;d a thought it would do any good
for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn&#39;t a done it or bust.

Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see
her go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:

&quot;What&#39;s the name of them people over on t&#39;other side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes?&quot;

They says:

&quot;There&#39;s several; but it&#39;s the Proctors, mainly.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the name,&quot; I says; &quot;I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she
told me to tell you she&#39;s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of
them&#39;s sick.&quot;

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;Sakes alive, I hope it ain&#39;t _Hanner_?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say it,&quot; I says, &quot;but Hanner&#39;s the very one.&quot;

&quot;My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
Jane said, and they don&#39;t think she&#39;ll last many hours.&quot;

&quot;Only think of that, now!  What&#39;s the matter with her?&quot;

I couldn&#39;t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:

&quot;Mumps.&quot;

&quot;Mumps your granny!  They don&#39;t set up with people that&#39;s got the
mumps.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t, don&#39;t they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.
 These mumps is different.  It&#39;s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s it a new kind?&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s mixed up with other things.&quot;

&quot;What other things?&quot;

&quot;Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don&#39;t know what all.&quot;

&quot;My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what Miss Mary Jane said.&quot;

&quot;Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?&quot;

&quot;Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That&#39;s what it starts with.&quot;

&quot;Well, ther&#39; ain&#39;t no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take
pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains
out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull
up and say, &#39;Why, he stumped his _toe_.&#39;  Would ther&#39; be any sense
in that? _No_.  And ther&#39; ain&#39;t no sense in _this_, nuther.  Is it
ketching?&quot;

&quot;Is it _ketching_?  Why, how you talk.  Is a _harrow_ catching--in the
dark? If you don&#39;t hitch on to one tooth, you&#39;re bound to on another,
ain&#39;t you? And you can&#39;t get away with that tooth without fetching the
whole harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a
harrow, as you may say--and it ain&#39;t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you
come to get it hitched on good.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s awful, I think,&quot; says the hare-lip.  &quot;I&#39;ll go to Uncle
Harvey and--&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; I says, &quot;I _would_.  Of _course_ I would.  I wouldn&#39;t lose no
time.&quot;

&quot;Well, why wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain&#39;t your uncles
obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you
reckon they&#39;d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves?  _you_ know they&#39;ll wait for you.  So fur, so
good. Your uncle Harvey&#39;s a preacher, ain&#39;t he?  Very well, then; is a
_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive
a _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now
_you_ know he ain&#39;t.  What _will_ he do, then?  Why, he&#39;ll say, &#39;It&#39;s a
great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they
can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,
and so it&#39;s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months
it takes to show on her if she&#39;s got it.&#39;  But never mind, if you think
it&#39;s best to tell your uncle Harvey--&quot;

&quot;Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane&#39;s
got it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins.&quot;

&quot;Well, anyway, maybe you&#39;d better tell some of the neighbors.&quot;

&quot;Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can&#39;t
you _see_ that _they&#39;d_ go and tell?  Ther&#39; ain&#39;t no way but just to not
tell anybody at _all_.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe you&#39;re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.&quot;

&quot;But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she&#39;s gone out a while,
anyway, so he won&#39;t be uneasy about her?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, &#39;Tell them to
give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I&#39;ve run over
the river to see Mr.&#39;--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your
uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--&quot;

&quot;Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can&#39;t ever seem to
remember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run
over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy
this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had
it than anybody else; and she&#39;s going to stick to them till they say
they&#39;ll come, and then, if she ain&#39;t too tired, she&#39;s coming home; and
if she is, she&#39;ll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don&#39;t say
nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which &#39;ll be
perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying
the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and
give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.

Everything was all right now.  The girls wouldn&#39;t say nothing because
they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther
Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
Doctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I
reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn&#39;t a done it no neater himself.  Of course he
would a throwed more style into it, but I can&#39;t do that very handy, not
being brung up to it.

Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end
of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing
for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.

But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was
sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So
they&#39;d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was
for wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it a
steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping
and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:

&quot;_Here&#39;s_ your opposition line! here&#39;s your two sets o&#39; heirs to old
Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!&quot;




CHAPTER XXIX.

THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,
how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn&#39;t see no
joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some
to see any.  I reckoned they&#39;d turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did
_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but
just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that&#39;s
googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed
down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in
his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
world.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people
gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old
gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty
soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an
Englishman--not the king&#39;s way, though the king&#39;s _was_ pretty good for
an imitation.  I can&#39;t give the old gent&#39;s words, nor I can&#39;t imitate
him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:

&quot;This is a surprise to me which I wasn&#39;t looking for; and I&#39;ll
acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain&#39;t very well fixed to meet it and
answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he&#39;s broke his
arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the
night by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks&#39; brother Harvey, and this is his
brother William, which can&#39;t hear nor speak--and can&#39;t even make signs to
amount to much, now&#39;t he&#39;s only got one hand to work them with.  We are
who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can
prove it. But up till then I won&#39;t say nothing more, but go to the hotel
and wait.&quot;

So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and
blethers out:

&quot;Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain&#39;t_ it?--and very convenient, too,
for a fraud that&#39;s got to make signs, and ain&#39;t learnt how.  Lost
their baggage! That&#39;s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the
_circumstances_!&quot;

So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,
or maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was
a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind
made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and
was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and
then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the
king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:

&quot;Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when&#39;d you come to this
town?&quot;

&quot;The day before the funeral, friend,&quot; says the king.

&quot;But what time o&#39; day?&quot;

&quot;In the evenin&#39;--&#39;bout an hour er two before sundown.&quot;

&quot;_How&#39;d_ you come?&quot;

&quot;I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, how&#39;d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_&#39;--in a
canoe?&quot;

&quot;I warn&#39;t up at the Pint in the mornin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie.&quot;

Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher.

&quot;Preacher be hanged, he&#39;s a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint
that mornin&#39;.  I live up there, don&#39;t I?  Well, I was up there, and
he was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim
Collins and a boy.&quot;

The doctor he up and says:

&quot;Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?&quot;

&quot;I reckon I would, but I don&#39;t know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know
him perfectly easy.&quot;

It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:

&quot;Neighbors, I don&#39;t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
_these_ two ain&#39;t frauds, I am an idiot, that&#39;s all.  I think it&#39;s our
duty to see that they don&#39;t get away from here till we&#39;ve looked into
this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We&#39;ll take
these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t&#39;other couple, and I
reckon we&#39;ll find out _something_ before we get through.&quot;

It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king&#39;s friends; so
we all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by
the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.

We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:

&quot;I don&#39;t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they&#39;re
frauds, and they may have complices that we don&#39;t know nothing about.
 If they have, won&#39;t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter
Wilks left?  It ain&#39;t unlikely.  If these men ain&#39;t frauds, they won&#39;t
object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
they&#39;re all right--ain&#39;t that so?&quot;

Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked
sorrowful, and says:

&quot;Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain&#39;t got no disposition
to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation
o&#39; this misable business; but, alas, the money ain&#39;t there; you k&#39;n send
and see, if you want to.&quot;

&quot;Where is it, then?&quot;

&quot;Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
inside o&#39; the straw tick o&#39; my bed, not wishin&#39; to bank it for the few
days we&#39;d be here, and considerin&#39; the bed a safe place, we not bein&#39;
used to niggers, and suppos&#39;n&#39; &#39;em honest, like servants in England.
 The niggers stole it the very next mornin&#39; after I had went down
stairs; and when I sold &#39;em I hadn&#39;t missed the money yit, so they got
clean away with it.  My servant here k&#39;n tell you &#39;bout it, gentlemen.&quot;

The doctor and several said &quot;Shucks!&quot; and I see nobody didn&#39;t altogether
believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said
no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up
my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
 That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:

&quot;Are _you_ English, too?&quot;

I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, &quot;Stuff!&quot;

Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and
kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They
made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his&#39;n;
and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the
old gentleman was spinning truth and t&#39;other one lies.  And by and by
they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed
look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the
right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,
and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn&#39;t get pretty
fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:

&quot;Set down, my boy; I wouldn&#39;t strain myself if I was you.  I reckon
you ain&#39;t used to lying, it don&#39;t seem to come handy; what you want is
practice.  You do it pretty awkward.&quot;

I didn&#39;t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
anyway.

The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:

&quot;If you&#39;d been in town at first, Levi Bell--&quot; The king broke in and
reached out his hand, and says:

&quot;Why, is this my poor dead brother&#39;s old friend that he&#39;s wrote so often
about?&quot;

The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side
and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:

&quot;That &#39;ll fix it.  I&#39;ll take the order and send it, along with your
brother&#39;s, and then they&#39;ll know it&#39;s all right.&quot;

So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;
and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the
duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says:

&quot;You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.&quot;

The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn&#39;t read it.  The lawyer looked
powerful astonished, and says:

&quot;Well, it beats _me_&quot;--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,
and examined them, and then examined the old man&#39;s writing, and then
_them_ again; and then says:  &quot;These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;
and here&#39;s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn&#39;t
write them&quot; (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell
you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), &quot;and here&#39;s _this_ old
gentleman&#39;s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn&#39;t
write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain&#39;t properly _writing_ at
all.  Now, here&#39;s some letters from--&quot;

The new old gentleman says:

&quot;If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
there--so he copies for me.  It&#39;s _his_ hand you&#39;ve got there, not mine.&quot;

&quot;_Well_!&quot; says the lawyer, &quot;this _is_ a state of things.  I&#39;ve got some
of William&#39;s letters, too; so if you&#39;ll get him to write a line or so we
can com--&quot;

&quot;He _can&#39;t_ write with his left hand,&quot; says the old gentleman.  &quot;If he
could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters
and mine too.  Look at both, please--they&#39;re by the same hand.&quot;

The lawyer done it, and says:

&quot;I believe it&#39;s so--and if it ain&#39;t so, there&#39;s a heap stronger
resemblance than I&#39;d noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I
thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it&#39;s gone to grass,
partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain&#39;t either of &#39;em
Wilkses&quot;--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.

Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn&#39;t give in
_then_! Indeed he wouldn&#39;t.  Said it warn&#39;t no fair test.  Said his
brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn&#39;t tried
to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute
he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and
warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was
saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:

&quot;I&#39;ve thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay
out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; says somebody, &quot;me and Ab Turner done it.  We&#39;re both here.&quot;

Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:

&quot;Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?&quot;

Blamed if the king didn&#39;t have to brace up mighty quick, or he&#39;d a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took
him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make
most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any
notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?
 He whitened a little; he couldn&#39;t help it; and it was mighty still in
there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says
I to myself, _now_ he&#39;ll throw up the sponge--there ain&#39;t no more use.
 Well, did he?  A body can&#39;t hardly believe it, but he didn&#39;t.  I reckon
he thought he&#39;d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so
they&#39;d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.
 Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:

&quot;Mf!  It&#39;s a _very_ tough question, _ain&#39;t_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k&#39;n
tell you what&#39;s tattooed on his breast.  It&#39;s jest a small, thin, blue
arrow--that&#39;s what it is; and if you don&#39;t look clost, you can&#39;t see it.
 _now_ what do you say--hey?&quot;

Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
cheek.

The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and
his eye lights up like he judged he&#39;d got the king _this_ time, and
says:

&quot;There--you&#39;ve heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter
Wilks&#39; breast?&quot;

Both of them spoke up and says:

&quot;We didn&#39;t see no such mark.&quot;

&quot;Good!&quot; says the old gentleman.  &quot;Now, what you _did_ see on his breast
was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W&quot;--and he marked
them that way on a piece of paper.  &quot;Come, ain&#39;t that what you saw?&quot;

Both of them spoke up again, and says:

&quot;No, we _didn&#39;t_.  We never seen any marks at all.&quot;

Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:

&quot;The whole _bilin_&#39; of &#39;m &#39;s frauds!  Le&#39;s duck &#39;em! le&#39;s drown &#39;em!
le&#39;s ride &#39;em on a rail!&quot; and everybody was whooping at once, and there
was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,
and says:

&quot;Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you
_please_!  There&#39;s one way yet--let&#39;s go and dig up the corpse and look.&quot;

That took them.

&quot;Hooray!&quot; they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out:

&quot;Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
_them_ along, too!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do it!&quot; they all shouted; &quot;and if we don&#39;t find them marks we&#39;ll
lynch the whole gang!&quot;

I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn&#39;t no getting away, you
know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole
town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
evening.

As we went by our house I wished I hadn&#39;t sent Mary Jane out of town;
because now if I could tip her the wink she&#39;d light out and save me, and
blow on our dead-beats.

Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from
what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they
didn&#39;t find them--

I couldn&#39;t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn&#39;t think
about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the
wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He
dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.

When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn&#39;t
thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a
mile off, to borrow one.

So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took
no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute
you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the
shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the
dark wiped it all out, and you couldn&#39;t see nothing at all.

At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to
scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it
was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,
and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and
panting.

All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,
and somebody sings out:

&quot;By the living jingo, here&#39;s the bag of gold on his breast!&quot;

Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and
give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit
out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain&#39;t nobody can tell.

I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all
to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!

When I struck the town I see there warn&#39;t nobody out in the storm, so
I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the
main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and
set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and
disappointed, I didn&#39;t know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,
_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane&#39;s window! and my heart swelled up
sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind
me in the dark, and wasn&#39;t ever going to be before me no more in this
world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.

The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first
time the lightning showed me one that wasn&#39;t chained I snatched it and
shoved. It was a canoe, and warn&#39;t fastened with nothing but a rope.
 The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the
middle of the river, but I didn&#39;t lose no time; and when I struck the
raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp
if I could afforded it.  But I didn&#39;t.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:

&quot;Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we&#39;re shut
of them!&quot;

Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so
full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up
in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke, but I says:

&quot;Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and
let her slide!&quot;

So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_
seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and
nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack
my heels a few times--I couldn&#39;t help it; but about the third crack
I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and
listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out
over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and
making their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.

So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was
all I could do to keep from crying.




CHAPTER XXX.

WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,
and says:

&quot;Tryin&#39; to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,
hey?&quot;

I says:

&quot;No, your majesty, we warn&#39;t--_please_ don&#39;t, your majesty!&quot;

&quot;Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I&#39;ll shake the
insides out o&#39; you!&quot;

&quot;Honest, I&#39;ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
 The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he
had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry
to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
of me and whispers, &#39;Heel it now, or they&#39;ll hang ye, sure!&#39; and I lit
out.  It didn&#39;t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn&#39;t do nothing,
and I didn&#39;t want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped
running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
or they&#39;d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
duke wasn&#39;t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was
awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, &quot;Oh,
yes, it&#39;s _mighty_ likely!&quot; and shook me up again, and said he reckoned
he&#39;d drownd me.  But the duke says:

&quot;Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did
you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don&#39;t remember it.&quot;

So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it. But the duke says:

&quot;You better a blame&#39; sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you&#39;re
the one that&#39;s entitled to it most.  You hain&#39;t done a thing from the
start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky
with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right
down bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn&#39;t been
for that they&#39;d a jailed us till them Englishmen&#39;s baggage come--and
then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took &#39;em to the
graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
excited fools hadn&#39;t let go all holts and made that rush to get a
look we&#39;d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,
too--longer than _we&#39;d_ need &#39;em.&quot;

They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of
absent-minded like:

&quot;Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!&quot;

That made me squirm!

&quot;Yes,&quot; says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, &quot;_we_
did.&quot;

After about a half a minute the king drawls out:

&quot;Leastways, I did.&quot;

The duke says, the same way:

&quot;On the contrary, I did.&quot;

The king kind of ruffles up, and says:

&quot;Looky here, Bilgewater, what&#39;r you referrin&#39; to?&quot;

The duke says, pretty brisk:

&quot;When it comes to that, maybe you&#39;ll let me ask, what was _you_
referring to?&quot;

&quot;Shucks!&quot; says the king, very sarcastic; &quot;but I don&#39;t know--maybe you was
asleep, and didn&#39;t know what you was about.&quot;

The duke bristles up now, and says:

&quot;Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame&#39; fool?
Don&#39;t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?&quot;

&quot;_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie!&quot;--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:

&quot;Take y&#39;r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!&quot;

The duke says:

&quot;Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,
intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig
it up, and have it all to yourself.&quot;

&quot;Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;
if you didn&#39;t put the money there, say it, and I&#39;ll b&#39;lieve you, and
take back everything I said.&quot;

&quot;You old scoundrel, I didn&#39;t, and you know I didn&#39;t.  There, now!&quot;

&quot;Well, then, I b&#39;lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now
_don&#39;t_ git mad; didn&#39;t you have it in your mind to hook the money and
hide it?&quot;

The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t care if I _did_, I didn&#39;t _do_ it, anyway.  But you not
only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.&quot;

&quot;I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that&#39;s honest.  I won&#39;t say
I warn&#39;t goin&#39; to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in
ahead o&#39; me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--&quot;

The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:

&quot;&#39;Nough!--I _own up!_&quot;

I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and
says:

&quot;If you ever deny it again I&#39;ll drown you.  It&#39;s _well_ for you to set
there and blubber like a baby--it&#39;s fitten for you, after the way
you&#39;ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
father.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it
saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for &#39;em.
 It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_
that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I&#39;d got out of the Nonesuch
and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!&quot;

The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:

&quot;Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn&#39;t me.&quot;

&quot;Dry up!  I don&#39;t want to hear no more out of you!&quot; says the duke.  &quot;And
_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They&#39;ve got all their own money back,
and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G&#39;long to bed, and
don&#39;t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long &#39;s _you_ live!&quot;

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other&#39;s arms.  They
both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn&#39;t get mellow
enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag
again.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got
to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.




CHAPTER XXXI.

WE dasn&#39;t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along
down the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
long ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the
first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and
dismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
begun to work the villages again.

First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn&#39;t make enough
for them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started
a dancing-school; but they didn&#39;t know no more how to dance than a
kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped
in and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at
yellocution; but they didn&#39;t yellocute long till the audience got up and
give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled
missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and
a little of everything; but they couldn&#39;t seem to have no luck.  So at
last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.

And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn&#39;t like the look of it.  We judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it
over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break
into somebody&#39;s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an
agreement that we wouldn&#39;t have nothing in the world to do with such
actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we
hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told
us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see
if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (&quot;House to
rob, you _mean_,&quot; says I to myself; &quot;and when you get through robbing it
you&#39;ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
raft--and you&#39;ll have to take it out in wondering.&quot;) And he said if he
warn&#39;t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and
we was to come along.

So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and
was in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn&#39;t
seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come
and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_
change on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and
hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
his might, and so tight he couldn&#39;t walk, and couldn&#39;t do nothing to
them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king
begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and
shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like
a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a
long day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all
out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:

&quot;Set her loose, Jim! we&#39;re all right now!&quot;

But there warn&#39;t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was
gone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run
this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn&#39;t
no use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn&#39;t help
it. But I couldn&#39;t set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and
asked him if he&#39;d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Whereabouts?&quot; says I.

&quot;Down to Silas Phelps&#39; place, two mile below here.  He&#39;s a runaway
nigger, and they&#39;ve got him.  Was you looking for him?&quot;

&quot;You bet I ain&#39;t!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago, and he said if I hollered he&#39;d cut my livers out--and told me to lay
down and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard
to come out.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;you needn&#39;t be afeard no more, becuz they&#39;ve got him.
He run off f&#39;m down South, som&#39;ers.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a good job they got him.&quot;

&quot;Well, I _reckon_!  There&#39;s two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It&#39;s
like picking up money out&#39;n the road.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I&#39;d been big enough; I see him
_first_. Who nailed him?&quot;

&quot;It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars, becuz he&#39;s got to go up the river and can&#39;t wait.  Think
o&#39; that, now!  You bet _I&#39;d_ wait, if it was seven year.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s me, every time,&quot; says I.  &quot;But maybe his chance ain&#39;t worth
no more than that, if he&#39;ll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there&#39;s something
ain&#39;t straight about it.&quot;

&quot;But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.
 It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells
the plantation he&#39;s frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, they
ain&#39;t no trouble &#39;bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a
chaw tobacker, won&#39;t ye?&quot;

I didn&#39;t have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the
wigwam to think.  But I couldn&#39;t come to nothing.  I thought till I wore
my head sore, but I couldn&#39;t see no way out of the trouble.  After all
this long journey, and after all we&#39;d done for them scoundrels, here it
was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make
him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
dirty dollars.

Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to
be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he&#39;d _got_ to be a
slave, and so I&#39;d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to
tell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two
things: she&#39;d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
for leaving her, and so she&#39;d sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didn&#39;t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
and they&#39;d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he&#39;d feel ornery and
disgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck
Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see
anybody from that town again I&#39;d be ready to get down and lick his boots
for shame.  That&#39;s just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
then he don&#39;t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he
can hide it, it ain&#39;t no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I
studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the
more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when
it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
poor old woman&#39;s nigger that hadn&#39;t ever done me no harm, and now was
showing me there&#39;s One that&#39;s always on the lookout, and ain&#39;t a-going
to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,
I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I
could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
up wicked, and so I warn&#39;t so much to blame; but something inside of me
kept saying, &quot;There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and
if you&#39;d a done it they&#39;d a learnt you there that people that acts as
I&#39;d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.&quot;

It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
couldn&#39;t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So
I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn&#39;t come.  Why wouldn&#39;t they?  It
warn&#39;t no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I
knowed very well why they wouldn&#39;t come.  It was because my heart warn&#39;t
right; it was because I warn&#39;t square; it was because I was playing
double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was
holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth
_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write
to that nigger&#39;s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can&#39;t pray a lie--I found
that out.

So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn&#39;t know what to
do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I&#39;ll go and write the letter--and
then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I
got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
and wrote:

Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send.

_Huck Finn._

I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn&#39;t do it
straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our
trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day
and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
couldn&#39;t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
other kind.  I&#39;d see him standing my watch on top of his&#39;n, &#39;stead of
calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when
I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,
up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he&#39;s
got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.

It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was
a-trembling, because I&#39;d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
says to myself:

&quot;All right, then, I&#39;ll _go_ to hell&quot;--and tore it up.

It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let
them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the
whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn&#39;t.  And
for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;
and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as
long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the
night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,
and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or
another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed
below where I judged was Phelps&#39;s place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.

Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on
it, &quot;Phelps&#39;s Sawmill,&quot; and when I come to the farm-houses, two or
three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn&#39;t
see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn&#39;t mind,
because I didn&#39;t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the
lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from
the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,
straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was
the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night
performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I
was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:

&quot;Hel-_lo_!  Where&#39;d _you_ come from?&quot;  Then he says, kind of glad and
eager, &quot;Where&#39;s the raft?--got her in a good place?&quot;

I says:

&quot;Why, that&#39;s just what I was going to ask your grace.&quot;

Then he didn&#39;t look so joyful, and says:

&quot;What was your idea for asking _me_?&quot; he says.

&quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says
to myself, we can&#39;t get him home for hours, till he&#39;s soberer; so I went
a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch
a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,
and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
him.  We didn&#39;t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we
fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and
see it was gone, I says to myself, &#39;They&#39;ve got into trouble and had to
leave; and they&#39;ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I&#39;ve got in
the world, and now I&#39;m in a strange country, and ain&#39;t got no property
no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;&#39; so I set down and
cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the
raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!&quot;

&quot;Blamed if I know--that is, what&#39;s become of the raft.  That old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but
what he&#39;d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and
found the raft gone, we said, &#39;That little rascal has stole our raft and
shook us, and run off down the river.&#39;&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the
world, and the only property.&quot;

&quot;We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we&#39;d come to consider him
_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble
enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,
there warn&#39;t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
shake. And I&#39;ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where&#39;s
that ten cents? Give it here.&quot;

I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to
spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the
money I had, and I hadn&#39;t had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never
said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:

&quot;Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We&#39;d skin him if he done
that!&quot;

&quot;How can he blow?  Hain&#39;t he run off?&quot;

&quot;No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money&#39;s
gone.&quot;

&quot;_Sold_ him?&quot;  I says, and begun to cry; &quot;why, he was _my_ nigger, and
that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.&quot;

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t _get_ your nigger, that&#39;s all--so dry up your
blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you&#39;d_ venture to blow on us?
 Blamed if I think I&#39;d trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--&quot;

He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes
before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:

&quot;I don&#39;t want to blow on nobody; and I ain&#39;t got no time to blow, nohow.
I got to turn out and find my nigger.&quot;

He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you&#39;ll
promise you won&#39;t blow, and won&#39;t let the nigger blow, I&#39;ll tell you
where to find him.&quot;

So I promised, and he says:

&quot;A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--&quot; and then he stopped.  You see, he
started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to
study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he
was. He wouldn&#39;t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of
the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:

&quot;The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he
lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; I says, &quot;I can walk it in three days.  And I&#39;ll start this
very afternoon.&quot;

&quot;No you wont, you&#39;ll start _now_; and don&#39;t you lose any time about it,
neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along, and then you won&#39;t get into trouble with
_us_, d&#39;ye hear?&quot;

That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I
wanted to be left free to work my plans.

&quot;So clear out,&quot; he says; &quot;and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some
idiots don&#39;t require documents--leastways I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s such down
South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward&#39;s bogus,
maybe he&#39;ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for
getting &#39;em out.  Go &#39;long now, and tell him anything you want to; but
mind you don&#39;t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.&quot;

So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn&#39;t look around, but I
kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out
at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before
I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps&#39;.  I
reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around, because I wanted to stop Jim&#39;s mouth till these fellows could
get away.  I didn&#39;t want no trouble with their kind.  I&#39;d seen all I
wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.




CHAPTER XXXII.

WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybody&#39;s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it&#39;s
spirits whispering--spirits that&#39;s been dead ever so many years--and you
always think they&#39;re talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes a
body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.

Phelps&#39; was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they
all look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out
of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different
length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when
they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the
big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the
nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,
with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes
been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house
back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t&#39;other
side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against
the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;
ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by
the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there
in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away
off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place
by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then
the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.

I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and
started for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum
of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;
and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the
lonesomest sound in the whole world.

I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
I&#39;d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth
if I left it alone.

When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And
such another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of
fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.

A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
hand, singing out, &quot;Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!&quot; and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain&#39;t
no harm in a hound, nohow.

And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
mother&#39;s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way
they always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,
about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick
in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the
same way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she
could hardly stand--and says:

&quot;It&#39;s _you_, at last!--_ain&#39;t_ it?&quot;

I out with a &quot;Yes&#39;m&quot; before I thought.

She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands
and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;
and she couldn&#39;t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, &quot;You
don&#39;t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law
sakes, I don&#39;t care for that, I&#39;m so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it
does seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it&#39;s your cousin Tom!--tell
him howdy.&quot;

But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
hid behind her.  So she run on:

&quot;Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get
your breakfast on the boat?&quot;

I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,
leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got
there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:

&quot;Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I&#39;ve been hungry
for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it&#39;s come
at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep&#39;
you?--boat get aground?&quot;

&quot;Yes&#39;m--she--&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say yes&#39;m--say Aunt Sally.  Where&#39;d she get aground?&quot;

I didn&#39;t rightly know what to say, because I didn&#39;t know whether the
boat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on
instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards
Orleans. That didn&#39;t help me much, though; for I didn&#39;t know the names
of bars down that way.  I see I&#39;d got to invent a bar, or forget the
name of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched
it out:

&quot;It warn&#39;t the grounding--that didn&#39;t keep us back but a little.  We
blowed out a cylinder-head.&quot;

&quot;Good gracious! anybody hurt?&quot;

&quot;No&#39;m.  Killed a nigger.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago
last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And
I think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed
a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I
remember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had to
amputate him. But it didn&#39;t save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that
was it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious
resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle&#39;s been up
to the town every day to fetch you. And he&#39;s gone again, not more&#39;n an
hour ago; he&#39;ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,
didn&#39;t you?--oldish man, with a--&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,
and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too
soon; and so I come down the back way.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;d you give the baggage to?&quot;

&quot;Nobody.&quot;

&quot;Why, child, it &#39;ll be stole!&quot;

&quot;Not where I hid it I reckon it won&#39;t,&quot; I says.

&quot;How&#39;d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?&quot;

It was kinder thin ice, but I says:

&quot;The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers&#39;
lunch, and give me all I wanted.&quot;

I was getting so uneasy I couldn&#39;t listen good.  I had my mind on the
children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump
them a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn&#39;t get no show, Mrs.
Phelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back, because she says:

&quot;But here we&#39;re a-running on this way, and you hain&#39;t told me a word
about Sis, nor any of them.  Now I&#39;ll rest my works a little, and you
start up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about &#39;m all every
one of &#39;m; and how they are, and what they&#39;re doing, and what they told
you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.&quot;

Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by
me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it
warn&#39;t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I&#39;d got to throw up my hand.  So
I says to myself, here&#39;s another place where I got to resk the truth.
 I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind
the bed, and says:

&quot;Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that&#39;ll do; you can&#39;t
be seen now.  Don&#39;t you let on you&#39;re here.  I&#39;ll play a joke on him.
Children, don&#39;t you say a word.&quot;

I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn&#39;t no use to worry; there warn&#39;t
nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck.

I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
the bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:

&quot;Has he come?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says her husband.

&quot;Good-_ness_ gracious!&quot; she says, &quot;what in the warld can have become of
him?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine,&quot; says the old gentleman; &quot;and I must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy.&quot;

&quot;Uneasy!&quot; she says; &quot;I&#39;m ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; and
you&#39;ve missed him along the road.  I _know_ it&#39;s so--something tells me
so.&quot;

&quot;Why, Sally, I _couldn&#39;t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.&quot;

&quot;But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a
missed him.  He--&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t distress me any more&#39;n I&#39;m already distressed.  I don&#39;t know
what in the world to make of it.  I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end, and I don&#39;t mind
acknowledging &#39;t I&#39;m right down scared.  But there&#39;s no hope that he&#39;s
come; for he _couldn&#39;t_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it&#39;s terrible--just
terrible--something&#39;s happened to the boat, sure!&quot;

&quot;Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain&#39;t that somebody coming?&quot;

He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.
Phelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the
bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and
I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,
and says:

&quot;Why, who&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Who do you reckon &#39;t is?&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t no idea.  Who _is_ it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s _Tom Sawyer!_&quot;

By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn&#39;t no time to
swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
and the rest of the tribe.

But if they was joyful, it warn&#39;t nothing to what I was; for it was like
being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze
to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn&#39;t
hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the
Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
White River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,
and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn&#39;t know but what it would take
three days to fix it.  If I&#39;d a called it a bolthead it would a done
just as well.

Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s&#39;pose
Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s&#39;pose he steps in here any
minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
quiet?

Well, I couldn&#39;t _have_ it that way; it wouldn&#39;t do at all.  I must go
up the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go
up to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for
going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and
I druther he wouldn&#39;t take no trouble about me.




CHAPTER XXXIII.

SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a
wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and
waited till he come along.  I says &quot;Hold on!&quot; and it stopped alongside,
and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed
two or three times like a person that&#39;s got a dry throat, and then says:

&quot;I hain&#39;t ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you
want to come back and ha&#39;nt _me_ for?&quot;

I says:

&quot;I hain&#39;t come back--I hain&#39;t been _gone_.&quot;

When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn&#39;t quite
satisfied yet.  He says:

&quot;Don&#39;t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn&#39;t on you.  Honest injun
now, you ain&#39;t a ghost?&quot;

&quot;Honest injun, I ain&#39;t,&quot; I says.

&quot;Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can&#39;t somehow
seem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn&#39;t you ever murdered _at
all?_&quot;

&quot;No.  I warn&#39;t ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in
here and feel of me if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot;

So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me
again he didn&#39;t know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it
right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it
hit him where he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and
told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told
him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He
said, let him alone a minute, and don&#39;t disturb him.  So he thought and
thought, and pretty soon he says:

&quot;It&#39;s all right; I&#39;ve got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on
it&#39;s your&#39;n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to; and I&#39;ll go towards town a piece, and
take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
and you needn&#39;t let on to know me at first.&quot;

I says:

&quot;All right; but wait a minute.  There&#39;s one more thing--a thing that
_nobody_ don&#39;t know but me.  And that is, there&#39;s a nigger here that
I&#39;m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss
Watson&#39;s Jim.&quot;

He says:

&quot;What!  Why, Jim is--&quot;

He stopped and went to studying.  I says:

&quot;I know what you&#39;ll say.  You&#39;ll say it&#39;s dirty, low-down business; but
what if it is?  I&#39;m low down; and I&#39;m a-going to steal him, and I want
you keep mum and not let on.  Will you?&quot;

His eye lit up, and he says:

&quot;I&#39;ll _help_ you steal him!&quot;

Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most
astonishing speech I ever heard--and I&#39;m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation.  Only I couldn&#39;t believe it.  Tom Sawyer
a _nigger-stealer!_

&quot;Oh, shucks!&quot;  I says; &quot;you&#39;re joking.&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39;t joking, either.&quot;

&quot;Well, then,&quot; I says, &quot;joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger, don&#39;t forget to remember that _you_ don&#39;t know
nothing about him, and I don&#39;t know nothing about him.&quot;

Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his
way and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and
he says:

&quot;Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
to do it?  I wish we&#39;d a timed her.  And she hain&#39;t sweated a hair--not
a hair. It&#39;s wonderful.  Why, I wouldn&#39;t take a hundred dollars for that
horse now--I wouldn&#39;t, honest; and yet I&#39;d a sold her for fifteen before,
and thought &#39;twas all she was worth.&quot;

That&#39;s all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.
But it warn&#39;t surprising; because he warn&#39;t only just a farmer, he was
a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
worth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and
done the same way, down South.

In about half an hour Tom&#39;s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
yards, and says:

&quot;Why, there&#39;s somebody come!  I wonder who &#39;tis?  Why, I do believe it&#39;s
a stranger.  Jimmy&quot; (that&#39;s one of the children) &quot;run and tell Lize to
put on another plate for dinner.&quot;

Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
don&#39;t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
interest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for
the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
was all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an
audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances
it warn&#39;t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable.  He warn&#39;t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,
he come ca&#39;m and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn&#39;t want to disturb them,
and says:

&quot;Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?&quot;

&quot;No, my boy,&quot; says the old gentleman, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say &#39;t your driver
has deceived you; Nichols&#39;s place is down a matter of three mile more.
Come in, come in.&quot;

Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, &quot;Too late--he&#39;s out
of sight.&quot;

&quot;Yes, he&#39;s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us; and then we&#39;ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I _can&#39;t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn&#39;t think of it.  I&#39;ll
walk--I don&#39;t mind the distance.&quot;

&quot;But we won&#39;t _let_ you walk--it wouldn&#39;t be Southern hospitality to do
it. Come right in.&quot;

&quot;Oh, _do_,&quot; says Aunt Sally; &quot;it ain&#39;t a bit of trouble to us, not a
bit in the world.  You must stay.  It&#39;s a long, dusty three mile, and
we can&#39;t let you walk.  And, besides, I&#39;ve already told &#39;em to put on
another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn&#39;t disappoint us.  Come
right in and make yourself at home.&quot;

So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger
from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made
another bow.

Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was
going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of
her hand, and says:

&quot;You owdacious puppy!&quot;

He looked kind of hurt, and says:

&quot;I&#39;m surprised at you, m&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re s&#39;rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I&#39;ve a good notion to take
and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?&quot;

He looked kind of humble, and says:

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean nothing, m&#39;am.  I didn&#39;t mean no harm.  I--I--thought you&#39;d
like it.&quot;

&quot;Why, you born fool!&quot;  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
 &quot;What made you think I&#39;d like it?&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.&quot;

&quot;_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you&#39;s _another_ lunatic.  I
never heard the beat of it.  Who&#39;s _they_?&quot;

&quot;Why, everybody.  They all said so, m&#39;am.&quot;

It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her
fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:

&quot;Who&#39;s &#39;everybody&#39;?  Out with their names, or ther&#39;ll be an idiot
short.&quot;

He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, and I warn&#39;t expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told
me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she&#39;d like it.  They all said
it--every one of them.  But I&#39;m sorry, m&#39;am, and I won&#39;t do it no more--I
won&#39;t, honest.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t, won&#39;t you?  Well, I sh&#39;d _reckon_ you won&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;No&#39;m, I&#39;m honest about it; I won&#39;t ever do it again--till you ask me.&quot;

&quot;Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
 I lay you&#39;ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask
you--or the likes of you.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;it does surprise me so.  I can&#39;t make it out, somehow.
They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--&quot; He stopped and
looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman&#39;s, and says, &quot;Didn&#39;t
_you_ think she&#39;d like me to kiss her, sir?&quot;

&quot;Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b&#39;lieve I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:

&quot;Tom, didn&#39;t _you_ think Aunt Sally &#39;d open out her arms and say, &#39;Sid
Sawyer--&#39;&quot;

&quot;My land!&quot; she says, breaking in and jumping for him, &quot;you impudent
young rascal, to fool a body so--&quot; and was going to hug him, but he
fended her off, and says:

&quot;No, not till you&#39;ve asked me first.&quot;

So she didn&#39;t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he
took what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:

&quot;Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn&#39;t looking for _you_
at all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but
him.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because it warn&#39;t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,&quot; he
says; &quot;but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me
come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a
first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me
to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it
was a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain&#39;t no healthy place for a stranger
to come.&quot;

&quot;No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I
hain&#39;t been so put out since I don&#39;t know when.  But I don&#39;t care, I
don&#39;t mind the terms--I&#39;d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don&#39;t deny it, I
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.&quot;

We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and
the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven
families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that&#39;s laid
in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of
old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long
blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn&#39;t cool it a bit,
neither, the way I&#39;ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.
 There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me
and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn&#39;t no use, they
didn&#39;t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid
to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little
boys says:

&quot;Pa, mayn&#39;t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says the old man, &quot;I reckon there ain&#39;t going to be any; and you
couldn&#39;t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and
me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the
people; so I reckon they&#39;ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town
before this time.&quot;

So there it was!--but I couldn&#39;t help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to
bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn&#39;t believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn&#39;t hurry up
and give them one they&#39;d get into trouble sure.

On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,
and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn&#39;t come back no more, and
what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our
Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had
time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;
and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was
all over tar and feathers, and didn&#39;t look like nothing in the
world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big
soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for
them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn&#39;t ever feel any
hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to
see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.

We see we was too late--couldn&#39;t do no good.  We asked some stragglers
about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
the house rose up and went for them.

So we poked along back home, and I warn&#39;t feeling so brash as I was
before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
I hadn&#39;t done nothing.  But that&#39;s always the way; it don&#39;t make no
difference whether you do right or wrong, a person&#39;s conscience ain&#39;t
got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that
didn&#39;t know no more than a person&#39;s conscience does I would pison him.
It takes up more room than all the rest of a person&#39;s insides, and yet
ain&#39;t no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.




CHAPTER XXXIV.

WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:

&quot;Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I
know where Jim is.&quot;

&quot;No!  Where?&quot;

&quot;In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at
dinner, didn&#39;t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What did you think the vittles was for?&quot;

&quot;For a dog.&quot;

&quot;So &#39;d I. Well, it wasn&#39;t for a dog.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because part of it was watermelon.&quot;

&quot;So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and
don&#39;t see at the same time.&quot;

&quot;Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
and it ain&#39;t likely there&#39;s two prisoners on such a little plantation,
and where the people&#39;s all so kind and good.  Jim&#39;s the prisoner.  All
right--I&#39;m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn&#39;t give shucks
for any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we&#39;ll take the one we like
the best.&quot;

What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer&#39;s head I
wouldn&#39;t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,
but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
plan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:

&quot;Ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I says.

&quot;All right--bring it out.&quot;

&quot;My plan is this,&quot; I says.  &quot;We can easy find out if it&#39;s Jim in there.
Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old man&#39;s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
Jim used to do before.  Wouldn&#39;t that plan work?&quot;

&quot;_Work_?  Why, cert&#39;nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it&#39;s
too blame&#39; simple; there ain&#39;t nothing _to_ it.  What&#39;s the good of a
plan that ain&#39;t no more trouble than that?  It&#39;s as mild as goose-milk.
 Why, Huck, it wouldn&#39;t make no more talk than breaking into a soap
factory.&quot;

I never said nothing, because I warn&#39;t expecting nothing different; but
I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn&#39;t
have none of them objections to it.

And it didn&#39;t.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn&#39;t tell what it was here,
because I knowed it wouldn&#39;t stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.

Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,
before everybody.  I _couldn&#39;t_ understand it no way at all.  It was
outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be
his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:

&quot;Don&#39;t you reckon I know what I&#39;m about?  Don&#39;t I generly know what I&#39;m
about?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;_Well_, then.&quot;

That&#39;s all he said, and that&#39;s all I said.  It warn&#39;t no use to say any
more; because when he said he&#39;d do a thing, he always done it.  But I
couldn&#39;t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
let it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have
it so, I couldn&#39;t help it.

When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard
so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn&#39;t make
no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
the two sides; and on the side I warn&#39;t acquainted with--which was the
north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
one stout board nailed across it.  I says:

&quot;Here&#39;s the ticket.  This hole&#39;s big enough for Jim to get through if we
wrench off the board.&quot;

Tom says:

&quot;It&#39;s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that&#39;s a little more
complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.&quot;

&quot;Well, then,&quot; I says, &quot;how &#39;ll it do to saw him out, the way I done
before I was murdered that time?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s more _like_,&quot; he says.  &quot;It&#39;s real mysterious, and troublesome,
and good,&quot; he says; &quot;but I bet we can find a way that&#39;s twice as long.
 There ain&#39;t no hurry; le&#39;s keep on looking around.&quot;

Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long
as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at
the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,
and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn&#39;t no connection
with it; and there warn&#39;t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
 The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;

&quot;Now we&#39;re all right.  We&#39;ll _dig_ him out.  It &#39;ll take about a week!&quot;

Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have
to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don&#39;t fasten the doors--but that
warn&#39;t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought he&#39;d got to give it up; but after he
was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
time he made the trip.

In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it
_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through
breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim&#39;s nigger was piling up
a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
leaving, the key come from the house.

This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches
off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
strange words and noises, and he didn&#39;t believe he was ever witched so
long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so
about his troubles, he forgot all about what he&#39;d been a-going to do.
 So Tom says:

&quot;What&#39;s the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?&quot;

The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:

&quot;Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur&#39;us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at
&#39;im?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

I hunched Tom, and whispers:

&quot;You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn&#39;t the plan.&quot;

&quot;No, it warn&#39;t; but it&#39;s the plan _now_.&quot;

So, drat him, we went along, but I didn&#39;t like it much.  When we got in
we couldn&#39;t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure
enough, and could see us; and he sings out:

&quot;Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_&#39;! ain&#39; dat Misto Tom?&quot;

I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn&#39;t know
nothing to do; and if I had I couldn&#39;t a done it, because that nigger
busted in and says:

&quot;Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?&quot;

We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
kind of wondering, and says:

&quot;Does _who_ know us?&quot;

&quot;Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?&quot;

&quot;What _put_ it dar?  Didn&#39; he jis&#39; dis minute sing out like he knowed
you?&quot;

Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:

&quot;Well, that&#39;s mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
 _what_ did he sing out?&quot; And turns to me, perfectly ca&#39;m, and says,
&quot;Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?&quot;

Of course there warn&#39;t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:

&quot;No; I ain&#39;t heard nobody say nothing.&quot;

Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
and says:

&quot;Did you sing out?&quot;

&quot;No, sah,&quot; says Jim; &quot;I hain&#39;t said nothing, sah.&quot;

&quot;Not a word?&quot;

&quot;No, sah, I hain&#39;t said a word.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever see us before?&quot;

&quot;No, sah; not as I knows on.&quot;

So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
says, kind of severe:

&quot;What do you reckon&#39;s the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think
somebody sung out?&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s de dad-blame&#39; witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.
 Dey&#39;s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos&#39; kill me, dey sk&#39;yers me so.
 Please to don&#39;t tell nobody &#39;bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he&#39;ll scole
me; &#39;kase he say dey _ain&#39;t_ no witches.  I jis&#39; wish to goodness he was
heah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis&#39; bet he couldn&#39; fine no way to
git aroun&#39; it _dis_ time.  But it&#39;s awluz jis&#39; so; people dat&#39;s _sot_,
stays sot; dey won&#39;t look into noth&#39;n&#39;en fine it out f&#39;r deyselves, en
when _you_ fine it out en tell um &#39;bout it, dey doan&#39; b&#39;lieve you.&quot;

Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn&#39;t tell nobody; and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and
says:

&quot;I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to
catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn&#39;t give
him up, I&#39;d hang him.&quot;  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim
and says:

&quot;Don&#39;t ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on
nights, it&#39;s us; we&#39;re going to set you free.&quot;

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
come back, and we said we&#39;d come again some time if the nigger wanted
us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
around then.




CHAPTER XXXV.

IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how
to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;
what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that&#39;s called
fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a
dark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down
to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:

&quot;Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.
 There ain&#39;t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a
watchman.  There ain&#39;t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And
there&#39;s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
the chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
punkin-headed nigger, and don&#39;t send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim
could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn&#39;t be
no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,
Huck, it&#39;s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_
the difficulties.  Well, we can&#39;t help it; we got to do the best we can
with the materials we&#39;ve got. Anyhow, there&#39;s one thing--there&#39;s more
honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
where there warn&#39;t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was
their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your
own head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you
come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern&#39;s
resky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,
I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to
make a saw out of the first chance we get.&quot;

&quot;What do we want of a saw?&quot;

&quot;What do we _want_ of it?  Hain&#39;t we got to saw the leg of Jim&#39;s bed
off, so as to get the chain loose?&quot;

&quot;Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off.&quot;

&quot;Well, if that ain&#39;t just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up the
infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain&#39;t you ever read
any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,
nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just
so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can&#39;t be found, and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can&#39;t see
no sign of it&#39;s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.
Then, the night you&#39;re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip
off your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your
rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and
there&#39;s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and
fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
Navarre, or wherever it is. It&#39;s gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat
to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we&#39;ll dig one.&quot;

I says:

&quot;What do we want of a moat when we&#39;re going to snake him out from under
the cabin?&quot;

But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had
his chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his
head; then sighs again, and says:

&quot;No, it wouldn&#39;t do--there ain&#39;t necessity enough for it.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;  I says.

&quot;Why, to saw Jim&#39;s leg off,&quot; he says.

&quot;Good land!&quot;  I says; &quot;why, there ain&#39;t _no_ necessity for it.  And what
would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn&#39;t get the
chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would
be better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain&#39;t necessity
enough in this case; and, besides, Jim&#39;s a nigger, and wouldn&#39;t
understand the reasons for it, and how it&#39;s the custom in Europe; so
we&#39;ll let it go.  But there&#39;s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we
can send it to him in a pie; it&#39;s mostly done that way.  And I&#39;ve et
worse pies.&quot;

&quot;Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,&quot; I says; &quot;Jim ain&#39;t got no use for a
rope ladder.&quot;

&quot;He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don&#39;t
know nothing about it.  He&#39;s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.&quot;

&quot;What in the nation can he _do_ with it?&quot;

&quot;_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can&#39;t he?&quot;  That&#39;s what they
all do; and _he&#39;s_ got to, too.  Huck, you don&#39;t ever seem to want to do
anything that&#39;s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the
time. S&#39;pose he _don&#39;t_ do nothing with it? ain&#39;t it there in his bed,
for a clew, after he&#39;s gone? and don&#39;t you reckon they&#39;ll want clews?
 Of course they will.  And you wouldn&#39;t leave them any?  That would be a
_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn&#39;t_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;if it&#39;s in the regulations, and he&#39;s got to have
it, all right, let him have it; because I don&#39;t wish to go back on no
regulations; but there&#39;s one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up
our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we&#39;re going to get into trouble
with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you&#39;re born.  Now, the way I look at
it, a hickry-bark ladder don&#39;t cost nothing, and don&#39;t waste nothing,
and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,
as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain&#39;t had no
experience, and so he don&#39;t care what kind of a--&quot;

&quot;Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I&#39;d keep
still--that&#39;s what I&#39;D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping
by a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it&#39;s perfectly ridiculous.&quot;

&quot;Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you&#39;ll take my
advice, you&#39;ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.&quot;

He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:

&quot;Borrow a shirt, too.&quot;

&quot;What do we want of a shirt, Tom?&quot;

&quot;Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.&quot;

&quot;Journal your granny--_Jim_ can&#39;t write.&quot;

&quot;S&#39;pose he _can&#39;t_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can&#39;t he, if
we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrel-hoop?&quot;

&quot;Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one; and quicker, too.&quot;

&quot;_Prisoners_ don&#39;t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull
pens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of the
hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or
something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks
and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they&#39;ve got
to do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn&#39;t use a goose-quill
if they had it. It ain&#39;t regular.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what&#39;ll we make him the ink out of?&quot;

&quot;Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that&#39;s the common sort
and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;
and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message
to let the world know where he&#39;s captivated, he can write it on the
bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The
Iron Mask always done that, and it&#39;s a blame&#39; good way, too.&quot;

&quot;Jim ain&#39;t got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan.&quot;

&quot;That ain&#39;t nothing; we can get him some.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t nobody _read_ his plates.&quot;

&quot;That ain&#39;t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.  All _he&#39;s_ got to
do is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don&#39;t _have_ to be
able to read it. Why, half the time you can&#39;t read anything a prisoner
writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what&#39;s the sense in wasting the plates?&quot;

&quot;Why, blame it all, it ain&#39;t the _prisoner&#39;s_ plates.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s _somebody&#39;s_ plates, ain&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Well, spos&#39;n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--&quot;

He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we
cleared out for the house.

Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,
because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn&#39;t
borrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and
prisoners don&#39;t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
don&#39;t blame them for it, either.  It ain&#39;t no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it&#39;s his right; and
so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with.  He said if we warn&#39;t prisoners it would be a very
different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when
he warn&#39;t a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he
made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it
was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn&#39;t
need it to get out of prison with; there&#39;s where the difference was.
 He said if I&#39;d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim
to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at
that, though I couldn&#39;t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner
if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like
that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.

Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he
carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep
watch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk.  He says:

&quot;Everything&#39;s all right now except tools; and that&#39;s easy fixed.&quot;

&quot;Tools?&quot;  I says.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Tools for what?&quot;

&quot;Why, to dig with.  We ain&#39;t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?&quot;

&quot;Ain&#39;t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with?&quot;  I says.

He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:

&quot;Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,
and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
 Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what
kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as
well lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they
wouldn&#39;t furnish &#39;em to a king.&quot;

&quot;Well, then,&quot; I says, &quot;if we don&#39;t want the picks and shovels, what do
we want?&quot;

&quot;A couple of case-knives.&quot;

&quot;To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Confound it, it&#39;s foolish, Tom.&quot;

&quot;It don&#39;t make no difference how foolish it is, it&#39;s the _right_ way--and
it&#39;s the regular way.  And there ain&#39;t no _other_ way, that ever I heard
of, and I&#39;ve read all the books that gives any information about these
things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind
you; generly it&#39;s through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that
dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well, guess.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  A month and a half.&quot;

&quot;_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China.  _That&#39;s_ the kind.  I
wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.&quot;

&quot;_Jim_ don&#39;t know nobody in China.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s _that_ got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  But
you&#39;re always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can&#39;t you stick to
the main point?&quot;

&quot;All right--I don&#39;t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim
don&#39;t, either, I reckon.  But there&#39;s one thing, anyway--Jim&#39;s too old to
be dug out with a case-knife.  He won&#39;t last.&quot;

&quot;Yes he will _last_, too.  You don&#39;t reckon it&#39;s going to take
thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?&quot;

&quot;How long will it take, Tom?&quot;

&quot;Well, we can&#39;t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn&#39;t
take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
 He&#39;ll hear Jim ain&#39;t from there.  Then his next move will be to
advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can&#39;t resk being as long
digging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be
a couple of years; but we can&#39;t.  Things being so uncertain, what I
recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;
and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it
thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the
first time there&#39;s an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that &#39;ll be the best way.&quot;

&quot;Now, there&#39;s _sense_ in that,&quot; I says.  &quot;Letting on don&#39;t cost nothing;
letting on ain&#39;t no trouble; and if it&#39;s any object, I don&#39;t mind
letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn&#39;t strain
me none, after I got my hand in.  So I&#39;ll mosey along now, and smouch a
couple of case-knives.&quot;

&quot;Smouch three,&quot; he says; &quot;we want one to make a saw out of.&quot;

&quot;Tom, if it ain&#39;t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,&quot; I says,
&quot;there&#39;s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.&quot;

He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:

&quot;It ain&#39;t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and
smouch the knives--three of them.&quot;  So I done it.




CHAPTER XXXVI.

AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our
pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the
way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom
said he was right behind Jim&#39;s bed now, and we&#39;d dig in under it, and
when we got through there couldn&#39;t nobody in the cabin ever know there
was any hole there, because Jim&#39;s counter-pin hung down most to the
ground, and you&#39;d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
 So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn&#39;t see
we&#39;d done anything hardly.  At last I says:

&quot;This ain&#39;t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,
Tom Sawyer.&quot;

He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
Then he says:

&quot;It ain&#39;t no use, Huck, it ain&#39;t a-going to work.  If we was prisoners
it would, because then we&#39;d have as many years as we wanted, and no
hurry; and we wouldn&#39;t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn&#39;t get blistered, and
we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,
and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can&#39;t fool along; we got to
rush; we ain&#39;t got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another
night this way we&#39;d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
well--couldn&#39;t touch a case-knife with them sooner.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you.  It ain&#39;t right, and it ain&#39;t moral, and I wouldn&#39;t like
it to get out; but there ain&#39;t only just the one way:  we got to dig him
out with the picks, and _let on_ it&#39;s case-knives.&quot;

&quot;_Now_ you&#39;re _talking_!&quot;  I says; &quot;your head gets leveler and leveler
all the time, Tom Sawyer,&quot; I says.  &quot;Picks is the thing, moral or no
moral; and as for me, I don&#39;t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
 When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school
book, I ain&#39;t no ways particular how it&#39;s done so it&#39;s done.  What I
want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
Sunday-school book; and if a pick&#39;s the handiest thing, that&#39;s the thing
I&#39;m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school
book out with; and I don&#39;t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;there&#39;s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
this; if it warn&#39;t so, I wouldn&#39;t approve of it, nor I wouldn&#39;t stand by
and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
and a body ain&#39;t got no business doing wrong when he ain&#39;t ignorant and
knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,
_without_ any letting on, because you don&#39;t know no better; but it
wouldn&#39;t for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.&quot;

He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and
says:

&quot;Gimme a _case-knife_.&quot;

I didn&#39;t know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around
amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took
it and went to work, and never said a word.

He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.

So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,
and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing
his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn&#39;t come it, his
hands was so sore.  At last he says:

&quot;It ain&#39;t no use, it can&#39;t be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can&#39;t
you think of no way?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I says, &quot;but I reckon it ain&#39;t regular.  Come up the stairs, and
let on it&#39;s a lightning-rod.&quot;

So he done it.

Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I
hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
plates.  Tom says it wasn&#39;t enough; but I said nobody wouldn&#39;t ever see
the plates that Jim throwed out, because they&#39;d fall in the dog-fennel
and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and
he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:

&quot;Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.&quot;

&quot;Take them in through the hole,&quot; I says, &quot;when we get it done.&quot;

He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he
said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn&#39;t no need to
decide on any of them yet.  Said we&#39;d got to post Jim first.

That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took
one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard
Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn&#39;t wake him.  Then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half
the job was done.  We crept in under Jim&#39;s bed and into the cabin, and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,
and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us
hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,
and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how
unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,
and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and
not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
 So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old
times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told
him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt
Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:

&quot;_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We&#39;ll send you some things by them.&quot;

I said, &quot;Don&#39;t do nothing of the kind; it&#39;s one of the most jackass
ideas I ever struck;&quot; but he never paid no attention to me; went right
on.  It was his way when he&#39;d got his plans set.

So he told Jim how we&#39;d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and
we would put small things in uncle&#39;s coat-pockets and he must steal them
out; and we would tie things to aunt&#39;s apron-strings or put them in her
apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and
what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn&#39;t see
no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just
as Tom said.

Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to
bed, with hands that looked like they&#39;d been chawed.  Tom was in high
spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would
keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to
get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the
more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out
to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he
said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.

In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat&#39;s
notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
corn-pone that was in Jim&#39;s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how
it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most
mashed all his teeth out; and there warn&#39;t ever anything could a worked
better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only
just a piece of rock or something like that that&#39;s always getting into
bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he
jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.

And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim&#39;s bed; and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn&#39;t hardly room
in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered &quot;Witches&quot; once, and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was
dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim&#39;s meat,
and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door, and I knowed he&#39;d fixed the other door too.
Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
asking him if he&#39;d been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,
and blinked his eyes around, and says:

&quot;Mars Sid, you&#39;ll say I&#39;s a fool, but if I didn&#39;t b&#39;lieve I see most a
million dogs, er devils, er some&#39;n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
tracks.  I did, mos&#39; sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey
was all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis&#39; wisht I could git my han&#39;s on one
er dem witches jis&#39; wunst--on&#39;y jis&#39; wunst--it&#39;s all I&#39;d ast.  But mos&#39;ly
I wisht dey&#39;d lemme &#39;lone, I does.&quot;

Tom says:

&quot;Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this
runaway nigger&#39;s breakfast-time?  It&#39;s because they&#39;re hungry; that&#39;s
the reason.  You make them a witch pie; that&#39;s the thing for _you_ to
do.&quot;

&quot;But my lan&#39;, Mars Sid, how&#39;s I gwyne to make &#39;m a witch pie?  I doan&#39;
know how to make it.  I hain&#39;t ever hearn er sich a thing b&#39;fo&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, I&#39;ll have to make it myself.&quot;

&quot;Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I&#39;ll wusshup de groun&#39; und&#39; yo&#39; foot,
I will!&quot;

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll do it, seeing it&#39;s you, and you&#39;ve been good to us and
showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When
we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we&#39;ve put in the
pan, don&#39;t you let on you see it at all.  And don&#39;t you look when Jim
unloads the pan--something might happen, I don&#39;t know what.  And above
all, don&#39;t you _handle_ the witch-things.&quot;

&quot;_Hannel &#39;M_, Mars Sid?  What _is_ you a-talkin&#39; &#39;bout?  I wouldn&#39;
lay de weight er my finger on um, not f&#39;r ten hund&#39;d thous&#39;n billion
dollars, I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;




CHAPTER XXXVII.

THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile
in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces
of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as
we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails
that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt
Sally&#39;s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t&#39;other we stuck
in the band of Uncle Silas&#39;s hat, which was on the bureau, because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger&#39;s
house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the
pewter spoon in Uncle Silas&#39;s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn&#39;t come
yet, so we had to wait a little while.

And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn&#39;t hardly
wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one
hand and cracking the handiest child&#39;s head with her thimble with the
other, and says:

&quot;I&#39;ve hunted high and I&#39;ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_
become of your other shirt.&quot;

My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right
again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.
Uncle Silas he says:

&quot;It&#39;s most uncommon curious, I can&#39;t understand it.  I know perfectly
well I took it _off_, because--&quot;

&quot;Because you hain&#39;t got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I know
you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
memory, too, because it was on the clo&#39;s-line yesterday--I see it there
myself. But it&#39;s gone, that&#39;s the long and the short of it, and you&#39;ll
just have to change to a red flann&#39;l one till I can get time to make a
new one. And it &#39;ll be the third I&#39;ve made in two years.  It just keeps
a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to
_do_ with &#39;m all is more&#39;n I can make out.  A body &#39;d think you _would_
learn to take some sort of care of &#39;em at your time of life.&quot;

&quot;I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn&#39;t to be
altogether my fault, because, you know, I don&#39;t see them nor have
nothing to do with them except when they&#39;re on me; and I don&#39;t believe
I&#39;ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.&quot;

&quot;Well, it ain&#39;t _your_ fault if you haven&#39;t, Silas; you&#39;d a done it
if you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain&#39;t all that&#39;s gone, nuther.
 Ther&#39;s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain&#39;t all.  There was ten, and now
ther&#39;s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never
took the spoon, _that&#39;s_ certain.&quot;

&quot;Why, what else is gone, Sally?&quot;

&quot;Ther&#39;s six _candles_ gone--that&#39;s what.  The rats could a got the
candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don&#39;t walk off with the
whole place, the way you&#39;re always going to stop their holes and don&#39;t
do it; and if they warn&#39;t fools they&#39;d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you&#39;d_
never find it out; but you can&#39;t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I
know.&quot;

&quot;Well, Sally, I&#39;m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I&#39;ve been remiss; but
I won&#39;t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t hurry; next year &#39;ll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta
_Phelps!_&quot;

Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage, and says:

&quot;Missus, dey&#39;s a sheet gone.&quot;

&quot;A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land&#39;s sake!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stop up them holes to-day,&quot; says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.

&quot;Oh, _do_ shet up!--s&#39;pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where&#39;s_ it gone,
Lize?&quot;

&quot;Clah to goodness I hain&#39;t no notion, Miss&#39; Sally.  She wuz on de
clo&#39;sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain&#39; dah no mo&#39; now.&quot;

&quot;I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of it
in all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--&quot;

&quot;Missus,&quot; comes a young yaller wench, &quot;dey&#39;s a brass cannelstick
miss&#39;n.&quot;

&quot;Cler out from here, you hussy, er I&#39;ll take a skillet to ye!&quot;

Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned
I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She
kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,
with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in
Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:

&quot;It&#39;s _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;
and like as not you&#39;ve got the other things there, too.  How&#39;d it get
there?&quot;

&quot;I reely don&#39;t know, Sally,&quot; he says, kind of apologizing, &quot;or you know
I would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put
my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain&#39;t in; but
I&#39;ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I&#39;ll know I
didn&#39;t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
took up the spoon, and--&quot;

&quot;Oh, for the land&#39;s sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go &#39;long now, the whole
kit and biling of ye; and don&#39;t come nigh me again till I&#39;ve got back my
peace of mind.&quot;

I&#39;D a heard her if she&#39;d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it
out; and I&#39;d a got up and obeyed her if I&#39;d a been dead.  As we was
passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom
see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:

&quot;Well, it ain&#39;t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain&#39;t
reliable.&quot; Then he says:  &quot;But he done us a good turn with the spoon,
anyway, without knowing it, and so we&#39;ll go and do him one without _him_
knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.&quot;

There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard
steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes
the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t&#39;other,
looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,
first to one rat-hole and then another, till he&#39;d been to them all.
 Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle
and thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,
saying:

&quot;Well, for the life of me I can&#39;t remember when I done it.  I could
show her now that I warn&#39;t to blame on account of the rats.  But never
mind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn&#39;t do no good.&quot;

And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a
mighty nice old man.  And always is.

Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
we&#39;d got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out
he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to
counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of
them up my sleeve, and Tom says:

&quot;Why, Aunt Sally, there ain&#39;t but nine spoons _yet_.&quot;

She says:

&quot;Go &#39;long to your play, and don&#39;t bother me.  I know better, I counted
&#39;m myself.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can&#39;t make but nine.&quot;

She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody
would.

&quot;I declare to gracious ther&#39; _ain&#39;t_ but nine!&quot; she says.  &quot;Why, what in
the world--plague _take_ the things, I&#39;ll count &#39;m again.&quot;

So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she
says:

&quot;Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther&#39;s _ten_ now!&quot; and she looked huffy
and bothered both.  But Tom says:

&quot;Why, Aunty, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ten.&quot;

&quot;You numskull, didn&#39;t you see me _count &#39;m?_&quot;

&quot;I know, but--&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll count &#39;m _again_.&quot;

So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.
 Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so
mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she&#39;d start
to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they
come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed
up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
galley-west; and she said cle&#39;r out and let her have some peace, and if
we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she&#39;d skin
us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along
with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with
this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
because he said _now_ she couldn&#39;t ever count them spoons twice alike
again to save her life; and wouldn&#39;t believe she&#39;d counted them right if
she _did_; and said that after she&#39;d about counted her head off for the
next three days he judged she&#39;d give it up and offer to kill anybody
that wanted her to ever count them any more.

So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of
her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a
couple of days till she didn&#39;t know how many sheets she had any more,
and she didn&#39;t _care_, and warn&#39;t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her
soul out about it, and wouldn&#39;t count them again not to save her life;
she druther die first.

So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon
and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn&#39;t no consequence, it would
blow over by and by.

But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We
fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and
we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with
the smoke; because, you see, we didn&#39;t want nothing but a crust, and we
couldn&#39;t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course
we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,
in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long
before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person
with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.

And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn&#39;t go
into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
enough for forty pies if we&#39;d a wanted them, and plenty left over
for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole
dinner.

But we didn&#39;t need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and
so we throwed the rest away.  We didn&#39;t cook none of the pies in the
wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble
brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they
warn&#39;t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
pies, because we didn&#39;t know how, but she come up smiling on the last
one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a
pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would
want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
ladder wouldn&#39;t cramp him down to business I don&#39;t know nothing what I&#39;m
talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next
time, too.

Nat didn&#39;t look when we put the witch pie in Jim&#39;s pan; and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted
into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,
and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the
window-hole.




CHAPTER XXXVIII.

MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That&#39;s the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have
it; Tom said he&#39;d _got_ to; there warn&#39;t no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.

&quot;Look at Lady Jane Grey,&quot; he says; &quot;look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
Northumberland!  Why, Huck, s&#39;pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what
you going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim&#39;s _got_ to do his
inscription and coat of arms.  They all do.&quot;

Jim says:

&quot;Why, Mars Tom, I hain&#39;t got no coat o&#39; arm; I hain&#39;t got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;Jim&#39;s right, anyway, when he says he ain&#39;t got no coat
of arms, because he hain&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I reckon I knowed that,&quot; Tom says, &quot;but you bet he&#39;ll have one before
he goes out of this--because he&#39;s going out _right_, and there ain&#39;t
going to be no flaws in his record.&quot;

So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim
a-making his&#39;n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,
Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he&#39;d
struck so many good ones he didn&#39;t hardly know which to take, but there
was one which he reckoned he&#39;d decide on.  He says:

&quot;On the scutcheon we&#39;ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire
_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under
his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a
chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the
nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,
_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a
couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore
Fretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the
less speed.&quot;

&quot;Geewhillikins,&quot; I says, &quot;but what does the rest of it mean?&quot;

&quot;We ain&#39;t got no time to bother over that,&quot; he says; &quot;we got to dig in
like all git-out.&quot;

&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; I says, &quot;what&#39;s _some_ of it?  What&#39;s a fess?&quot;

&quot;A fess--a fess is--_you_ don&#39;t need to know what a fess is.  I&#39;ll show
him how to make it when he gets to it.&quot;

&quot;Shucks, Tom,&quot; I says, &quot;I think you might tell a person.  What&#39;s a bar
sinister?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know.  But he&#39;s got to have it.  All the nobility does.&quot;

That was just his way.  If it didn&#39;t suit him to explain a thing to you,
he wouldn&#39;t do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn&#39;t make no
difference.

He&#39;d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He
made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:

1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by
the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely
heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
years of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after
thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
natural son of Louis XIV.

Tom&#39;s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
When he got done he couldn&#39;t no way make up his mind which one for Jim
to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed
he would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a
year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
didn&#39;t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block
them out for him, and then he wouldn&#39;t have nothing to do but just
follow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:

&quot;Come to think, the logs ain&#39;t a-going to do; they don&#39;t have log walls
in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We&#39;ll fetch
a rock.&quot;

Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him
such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn&#39;t ever get out.
 But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to
see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky
tedious hard work and slow, and didn&#39;t give my hands no show to get
well of the sores, and we didn&#39;t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom
says:

&quot;I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
There&#39;s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we&#39;ll smouch it,
and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
too.&quot;

It warn&#39;t no slouch of an idea; and it warn&#39;t no slouch of a grindstone
nuther; but we allowed we&#39;d tackle it.  It warn&#39;t quite midnight yet,
so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the
grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn&#39;t keep her from falling
over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was
going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half
way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We
see it warn&#39;t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his
bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round
his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim
and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and
Tom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He
knowed how to do everything.

Our hole was pretty big, but it warn&#39;t big enough to get the grindstone
through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom
marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back
on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of
something, and says:

&quot;You got any spiders in here, Jim?&quot;

&quot;No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain&#39;t, Mars Tom.&quot;

&quot;All right, we&#39;ll get you some.&quot;

&quot;But bless you, honey, I doan&#39; _want_ none.  I&#39;s afeard un um.  I jis&#39;
&#39;s soon have rattlesnakes aroun&#39;.&quot;

Tom thought a minute or two, and says:

&quot;It&#39;s a good idea.  And I reckon it&#39;s been done.  It _must_ a been done;
it stands to reason.  Yes, it&#39;s a prime good idea.  Where could you keep
it?&quot;

&quot;Keep what, Mars Tom?&quot;

&quot;Why, a rattlesnake.&quot;

&quot;De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah I&#39;d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
my head.&quot;

&quot;Why, Jim, you wouldn&#39;t be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame
it.&quot;

&quot;_Tame_ it!&quot;

&quot;Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,
and they wouldn&#39;t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book
will tell you that.  You try--that&#39;s all I ask; just try for two or three
days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he&#39;ll love you;
and sleep with you; and won&#39;t stay away from you a minute; and will let
you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.&quot;

&quot;_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_&#39; talk so!  I can&#39;t _stan_&#39; it!  He&#39;d _let_
me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain&#39;t it?  I lay he&#39;d wait a
pow&#39;ful long time &#39;fo&#39; I _ast_ him.  En mo&#39; en dat, I doan&#39; _want_ him
to sleep wid me.&quot;

&quot;Jim, don&#39;t act so foolish.  A prisoner&#39;s _got_ to have some kind of a
dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain&#39;t ever been tried, why, there&#39;s more
glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
way you could ever think of to save your life.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mars Tom, I doan&#39; _want_ no sich glory.  Snake take &#39;n bite
Jim&#39;s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?  No, sah, I doan&#39; want no sich
doin&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Blame it, can&#39;t you _try_?  I only _want_ you to try--you needn&#39;t keep
it up if it don&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I&#39;s a tryin&#39; him.
Mars Tom, I&#39;s willin&#39; to tackle mos&#39; anything &#39;at ain&#39;t onreasonable,
but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I&#39;s
gwyne to _leave_, dat&#39;s _shore_.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you&#39;re so bull-headed about it.
 We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on
their tails, and let on they&#39;re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that &#39;ll have
to do.&quot;

&quot;I k&#39;n stan&#39; _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame&#39; &#39;f I couldn&#39; get along widout
um, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b&#39;fo&#39; &#39;t was so much bother and
trouble to be a prisoner.&quot;

&quot;Well, it _always_ is when it&#39;s done right.  You got any rats around
here?&quot;

&quot;No, sah, I hain&#39;t seed none.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;ll get you some rats.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mars Tom, I doan&#39; _want_ no rats.  Dey&#39;s de dadblamedest creturs
to &#39;sturb a body, en rustle roun&#39; over &#39;im, en bite his feet, when he&#39;s
tryin&#39; to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g&#39;yarter-snakes, &#39;f I&#39;s
got to have &#39;m, but doan&#39; gimme no rats; I hain&#39; got no use f&#39;r um,
skasely.&quot;

&quot;But, Jim, you _got_ to have &#39;em--they all do.  So don&#39;t make no more
fuss about it.  Prisoners ain&#39;t ever without rats.  There ain&#39;t no
instance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them
tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play
music to them.  You got anything to play music on?&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39; got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o&#39; paper, en a juice-harp;
but I reck&#39;n dey wouldn&#39; take no stock in a juice-harp.&quot;

&quot;Yes they would _they_ don&#39;t care what kind of music &#39;tis.  A
jews-harp&#39;s plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in a
prison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can&#39;t get no
other kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out
to see what&#39;s the matter with you.  Yes, you&#39;re all right; you&#39;re fixed
very well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,
and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play &#39;The Last Link
is Broken&#39;--that&#39;s the thing that &#39;ll scoop a rat quicker &#39;n anything
else; and when you&#39;ve played about two minutes you&#39;ll see all the rats,
and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,
and come.  And they&#39;ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good
time.&quot;

&quot;Yes, _dey_ will, I reck&#39;n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_
havin&#39;? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I&#39;ll do it ef I got to.  I
reck&#39;n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de
house.&quot;

Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn&#39;t nothing else; and
pretty soon he says:

&quot;Oh, there&#39;s one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you
reckon?&quot;

&quot;I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it&#39;s tolable dark in heah,
en I ain&#39; got no use f&#39;r no flower, nohow, en she&#39;d be a pow&#39;ful sight
o&#39; trouble.&quot;

&quot;Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it.&quot;

&quot;One er dem big cat-tail-lookin&#39; mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars
Tom, I reck&#39;n, but she wouldn&#39;t be wuth half de trouble she&#39;d coss.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you believe it.  We&#39;ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there, and raise it.  And don&#39;t call it mullen, call it
Pitchiola--that&#39;s its right name when it&#39;s in a prison.  And you want to
water it with your tears.&quot;

&quot;Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.
 It&#39;s the way they always do.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another man&#39;s a _start&#39;n_ one wid tears.&quot;

&quot;That ain&#39;t the idea.  You _got_ to do it with tears.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll die on my han&#39;s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan&#39; skasely
ever cry.&quot;

So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would
have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised
he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim&#39;s
coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would &quot;jis&#39; &#39;s soon have
tobacker in his coffee;&quot; and found so much fault with it, and with the
work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and
petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of
all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,
and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to
be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all
patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
himself, and yet he didn&#39;t know enough to appreciate them, and they was
just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn&#39;t
behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.




CHAPTER XXXIX.

IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour
we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put
it in a safe place under Aunt Sally&#39;s bed.  But while we was gone for
spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,
and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted
us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn&#39;t
the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
 I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.

We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet&#39;s
nest, but we didn&#39;t.  The family was at home.  We didn&#39;t give it right
up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we&#39;d
tire them out or they&#39;d got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
again, but couldn&#39;t set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in
a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and
a rattling good honest day&#39;s work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!
 And there warn&#39;t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn&#39;t
half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn&#39;t
matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So
we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn&#39;t no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You&#39;d see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they
generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most
of the time where you didn&#39;t want them.  Well, they was handsome and
striped, and there warn&#39;t no harm in a million of them; but that never
made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what
they might, and she couldn&#39;t stand them no way you could fix it; and
every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn&#39;t make no difference
what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I
never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You
couldn&#39;t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old
man so that he said he could most wish there hadn&#39;t ever been no snakes
created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn&#39;t over it yet; she warn&#39;t
near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump
right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all
women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or
other.

We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
allowed these lickings warn&#39;t nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them.  I didn&#39;t mind the lickings,
because they didn&#39;t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we
had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other
things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim&#39;s was when they&#39;d
all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn&#39;t like the spiders,
and the spiders didn&#39;t like Jim; and so they&#39;d lay for him, and make it
mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes
and the grindstone there warn&#39;t no room in bed for him, skasely; and
when there was, a body couldn&#39;t sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but
took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and
when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one
gang under him, in his way, and t&#39;other gang having a circus over him,
and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at
him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn&#39;t
ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.

Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
 The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he
would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;
the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all
going to die, but didn&#39;t.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever
see; and Tom said the same.

But as I was saying, we&#39;d got all the work done now, at last; and we was
all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote
a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their
runaway nigger, but hadn&#39;t got no answer, because there warn&#39;t no such
plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and
New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
the cold shivers, and I see we hadn&#39;t no time to lose. So Tom said, now
for the nonnamous letters.

&quot;What&#39;s them?&quot;  I says.

&quot;Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it&#39;s done one
way, sometimes another.  But there&#39;s always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going
to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It&#39;s a very good
way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We&#39;ll use them both.  And it&#39;s
usual for the prisoner&#39;s mother to change clothes with him, and she
stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We&#39;ll do that, too.&quot;

&quot;But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that
something&#39;s up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it&#39;s their
lookout.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know; but you can&#39;t depend on them.  It&#39;s the way they&#39;ve acted
from the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They&#39;re so confiding
and mullet-headed they don&#39;t take notice of nothing at all.  So if we
don&#39;t _give_ them notice there won&#39;t be nobody nor nothing to interfere
with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape &#39;ll go
off perfectly flat; won&#39;t amount to nothing--won&#39;t be nothing _to_ it.&quot;

&quot;Well, as for me, Tom, that&#39;s the way I&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Shucks!&quot; he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:

&quot;But I ain&#39;t going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits
me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that
yaller girl&#39;s frock.&quot;

&quot;Why, Tom, that &#39;ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
prob&#39;bly hain&#39;t got any but that one.&quot;

&quot;I know; but you don&#39;t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.&quot;

&quot;All right, then, I&#39;ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my
own togs.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?&quot;

&quot;No, but there won&#39;t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.&quot;

&quot;That ain&#39;t got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just
to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or
not. Hain&#39;t you got no principle at all?&quot;

&quot;All right, I ain&#39;t saying nothing; I&#39;m the servant-girl.  Who&#39;s Jim&#39;s
mother?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m his mother.  I&#39;ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, you&#39;ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.&quot;

&quot;Not much.  I&#39;ll stuff Jim&#39;s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim &#39;ll take the nigger woman&#39;s
gown off of me and wear it, and we&#39;ll all evade together.  When a
prisoner of style escapes it&#39;s called an evasion.  It&#39;s always called
so when a king escapes, f&#39;rinstance.  And the same with a king&#39;s son;
it don&#39;t make no difference whether he&#39;s a natural one or an unnatural
one.&quot;

So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench&#39;s
frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
way Tom told me to.  It said:

Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.

Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and
crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn&#39;t a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If
a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said &quot;ouch!&quot; if anything fell,
she jumped and said &quot;ouch!&quot; if you happened to touch her, when she
warn&#39;t noticing, she done the same; she couldn&#39;t face noway and be
satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying &quot;ouch,&quot; and
before she&#39;d got two-thirds around she&#39;d whirl back again, and say it
again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn&#39;t set up.  So the
thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work
more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.

So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going
to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the
lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter
said:

Don&#39;t betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of
cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and
will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
nigger&#39;s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn
if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as
they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his
chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your
leasure.  Don&#39;t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do
they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish
any reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._




CHAPTER XL.

WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn&#39;t know which end they
was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper, and wouldn&#39;t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a
word about the new letter, but didn&#39;t need to, because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally&#39;s dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch, but says:

&quot;Where&#39;s the butter?&quot;

&quot;I laid out a hunk of it,&quot; I says, &quot;on a piece of a corn-pone.&quot;

&quot;Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain&#39;t here.&quot;

&quot;We can get along without it,&quot; I says.

&quot;We can get along _with_ it, too,&quot; he says; &quot;just you slide down cellar
and fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
along. I&#39;ll go and stuff the straw into Jim&#39;s clothes to represent his
mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as
you get there.&quot;

So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as
a person&#39;s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of
corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs
very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes
Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped
my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:

&quot;You been down cellar?&quot;

&quot;Yes&#39;m.&quot;

&quot;What you been doing down there?&quot;

&quot;Noth&#39;n.&quot;

&quot;_Noth&#39;n!_&quot;

&quot;No&#39;m.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know &#39;m.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t _know_?  Don&#39;t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
you been _doing_ down there.&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
have.&quot;

I reckoned she&#39;d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
s&#39;pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warn&#39;t yard-stick straight; so she says,
very decided:

&quot;You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You
been up to something you no business to, and I lay I&#39;ll find out what it
is before I&#39;M done with you.&quot;

So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn&#39;t;
but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,
and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn&#39;t easy myself, but I
didn&#39;t take my hat off, all the same.

I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we&#39;d overdone this
thing, and what a thundering hornet&#39;s-nest we&#39;d got ourselves into, so
we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us.

At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn&#39;t_ answer
them straight, I didn&#39;t know which end of me was up; because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and
lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn&#39;t but a few minutes to
midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and
me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was
that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter
beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty
soon, when one of them says, &quot;I&#39;M for going and getting in the cabin
_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,&quot; I most
dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:

&quot;For the land&#39;s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He&#39;s got the
brain-fever as shore as you&#39;re born, and they&#39;re oozing out!&quot;

And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes
the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and
hugged me, and says:

&quot;Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it
ain&#39;t no worse; for luck&#39;s against us, and it never rains but it pours,
and when I see that truck I thought we&#39;d lost you, for I knowed by
the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,
dear, whyd&#39;nt you _tell_ me that was what you&#39;d been down there for, I
wouldn&#39;t a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don&#39;t lemme see no more of
you till morning!&quot;

I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn&#39;t hardly get my
words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,
with guns!

His eyes just blazed; and he says:

&quot;No!--is that so?  _ain&#39;t_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over
again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--&quot;

&quot;Hurry!  _Hurry_!&quot;  I says.  &quot;Where&#39;s Jim?&quot;

&quot;Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.
 He&#39;s dressed, and everything&#39;s ready.  Now we&#39;ll slide out and give the
sheep-signal.&quot;

But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:

&quot;I _told_ you we&#39;d be too soon; they haven&#39;t come--the door is locked.
Here, I&#39;ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for &#39;em in the
dark and kill &#39;em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,
and listen if you can hear &#39;em coming.&quot;

So in they come, but couldn&#39;t see us in the dark, and most trod on
us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all
right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,
and Tom last, which was according to Tom&#39;s orders.  Now we was in the
lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,
and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn&#39;t make
out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out
first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,
not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy
towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim
over it; but Tom&#39;s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top
rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks
and started somebody sings out:

&quot;Who&#39;s that?  Answer, or I&#39;ll shoot!&quot;

But we didn&#39;t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there
was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed
around us! We heard them sing out:

&quot;Here they are!  They&#39;ve broke for the river!  After &#39;em, boys, and turn
loose the dogs!&quot;

So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore
boots and yelled, but we didn&#39;t wear no boots and didn&#39;t yell.  We was
in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind
them.  They&#39;d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn&#39;t scare off the
robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they
come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we
stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn&#39;t
nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said
howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and
then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the
river, but didn&#39;t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we
struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and
we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the
bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when
we stepped on to the raft I says:

&quot;_Now_, old Jim, you&#39;re a free man again, and I bet you won&#39;t ever be a
slave no more.&quot;

&quot;En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It &#39;uz planned beautiful, en
it &#39;uz done beautiful; en dey ain&#39;t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat&#39;s mo&#39;
mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.&quot;

We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.

When me and Jim heard that we didn&#39;t feel so brash as what we did
before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in
the wigwam and tore up one of the duke&#39;s shirts for to bandage him, but
he says:

&quot;Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don&#39;t stop now; don&#39;t fool around
here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set
her loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--&#39;deed we did.  I wish _we&#39;d_ a
had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn&#39;t a been no &#39;Son of Saint
Louis, ascend to heaven!&#39; wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we&#39;d
a whooped him over the _border_--that&#39;s what we&#39;d a done with _him_--and
done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the
sweeps!&quot;

But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we&#39;d thought a
minute, I says:

&quot;Say it, Jim.&quot;

So he says:

&quot;Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat &#39;uz
bein&#39; sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, &#39;Go on
en save me, nemmine &#39;bout a doctor f&#39;r to save dis one?&#39;  Is dat like
Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn&#39;t!  _well_,
den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan&#39; budge a step out&#39;n dis
place &#39;dout a _doctor_, not if it&#39;s forty year!&quot;

I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he&#39;d say what he did say--so
it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.
 He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and
wouldn&#39;t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
himself; but we wouldn&#39;t let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,
but it didn&#39;t do no good.

So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:

&quot;Well, then, if you&#39;re bound to go, I&#39;ll tell you the way to do when you
get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse
full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the
back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the
canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take
his chalk away from him, and don&#39;t give it back to him till you get him
back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it
again. It&#39;s the way they all do.&quot;

So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
see the doctor coming till he was gone again.




CHAPTER XLI.

THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and
not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to
come home this evening and surprise the folks.

&quot;Who is your folks?&quot; he says.

&quot;The Phelpses, down yonder.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; he says.  And after a minute, he says:

&quot;How&#39;d you say he got shot?&quot;

&quot;He had a dream,&quot; I says, &quot;and it shot him.&quot;

&quot;Singular dream,&quot; he says.

So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But
when he sees the canoe he didn&#39;t like the look of her--said she was big
enough for one, but didn&#39;t look pretty safe for two.  I says:

&quot;Oh, you needn&#39;t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy
enough.&quot;

&quot;What three?&quot;

&quot;Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that&#39;s what I mean.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; he says.

But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,
and said he reckoned he&#39;d look around for a bigger one.  But they was
all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait
till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better
go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But
I said I didn&#39;t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he
started.

I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos&#39;n he can&#39;t fix
that leg just in three shakes of a sheep&#39;s tail, as the saying is?
spos&#39;n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay
around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what
_I&#39;ll_ do.  I&#39;ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he&#39;s got to
go any more I&#39;ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we&#39;ll take and tie
him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom&#39;s done
with him we&#39;ll give him what it&#39;s worth, or all we got, and then let him
get ashore.

So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the
doctor&#39;s house, but they told me he&#39;d gone away in the night some time
or other, and warn&#39;t back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad
for Tom, and I&#39;ll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,
and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas&#39;s
stomach! He says:

&quot;Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?&quot;

&quot;I hain&#39;t been nowheres,&quot; I says, &quot;only just hunting for the runaway
nigger--me and Sid.&quot;

&quot;Why, where ever did you go?&quot; he says.  &quot;Your aunt&#39;s been mighty
uneasy.&quot;

&quot;She needn&#39;t,&quot; I says, &quot;because we was all right.  We followed the men
and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over, but couldn&#39;t find nothing of them; so we cruised along
up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we
paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid&#39;s at the post-office to see
what he can hear, and I&#39;m a-branching out to get something to eat for
us, and then we&#39;re going home.&quot;

So then we went to the post-office to get &quot;Sid&quot;; but just as I
suspicioned, he warn&#39;t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn&#39;t come; so the old man
said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
fooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn&#39;t get him to let me stay
and wait for Sid; and he said there warn&#39;t no use in it, and I must come
along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.

When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and
cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that
don&#39;t amount to shucks, and said she&#39;d serve Sid the same when he come.

And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers&#39; wives, to dinner;
and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:

&quot;Well, Sister Phelps, I&#39;ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an&#39; I b&#39;lieve
the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn&#39;t I, Sister
Damrell?--s&#39;I, he&#39;s crazy, s&#39;I--them&#39;s the very words I said.  You all
hearn me: he&#39;s crazy, s&#39;I; everything shows it, s&#39;I.  Look at that-air
grindstone, s&#39;I; want to tell _me_&#39;t any cretur &#39;t&#39;s in his right mind
&#39;s a goin&#39; to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s&#39;I?
 Here sich &#39;n&#39; sich a person busted his heart; &#39;n&#39; here so &#39;n&#39; so
pegged along for thirty-seven year, &#39;n&#39; all that--natcherl son o&#39; Louis
somebody, &#39;n&#39; sich everlast&#39;n rubbage.  He&#39;s plumb crazy, s&#39;I; it&#39;s what
I says in the fust place, it&#39;s what I says in the middle, &#39;n&#39; it&#39;s what
I says last &#39;n&#39; all the time--the nigger&#39;s crazy--crazy &#39;s Nebokoodneezer,
s&#39;I.&quot;

&quot;An&#39; look at that-air ladder made out&#39;n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,&quot; says
old Mrs. Damrell; &quot;what in the name o&#39; goodness _could_ he ever want
of--&quot;

&quot;The very words I was a-sayin&#39; no longer ago th&#39;n this minute to Sister
Utterback, &#39;n&#39; she&#39;ll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag
ladder, sh-she; &#39;n&#39; s&#39;I, yes, _look_ at it, s&#39;I--what _could_ he a-wanted
of it, s&#39;I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--&quot;

&quot;But how in the nation&#39;d they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,
_anyway_? &#39;n&#39; who dug that-air _hole_? &#39;n&#39; who--&quot;

&quot;My very _words_, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin&#39;--pass that-air sasser o&#39;
m&#39;lasses, won&#39;t ye?--I was a-sayin&#39; to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,
how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s&#39;I.  Without _help_, mind
you--&#39;thout _help_!  _that&#39;s_ wher &#39;tis.  Don&#39;t tell _me_, s&#39;I; there
_wuz_ help, s&#39;I; &#39;n&#39; ther&#39; wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s&#39;I; ther&#39;s ben a
_dozen_ a-helpin&#39; that nigger, &#39;n&#39; I lay I&#39;d skin every last nigger on
this place but _I&#39;d_ find out who done it, s&#39;I; &#39;n&#39; moreover, s&#39;I--&quot;

&quot;A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn&#39;t a done every thing that&#39;s been
done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they&#39;ve been
made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with &#39;m, a week&#39;s work for six men;
look at that nigger made out&#39;n straw on the bed; and look at--&quot;

&quot;You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower!  It&#39;s jist as I was a-sayin&#39;
to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S&#39;e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister
Hotchkiss, s&#39;e? Think o&#39; what, Brer Phelps, s&#39;I?  Think o&#39; that bed-leg
sawed off that a way, s&#39;e?  _think_ of it, s&#39;I?  I lay it never sawed
_itself_ off, s&#39;I--somebody _sawed_ it, s&#39;I; that&#39;s my opinion, take it
or leave it, it mayn&#39;t be no &#39;count, s&#39;I, but sich as &#39;t is, it&#39;s my
opinion, s&#39;I, &#39;n&#39; if any body k&#39;n start a better one, s&#39;I, let him _do_
it, s&#39;I, that&#39;s all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s&#39;I--&quot;

&quot;Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o&#39; niggers in there
every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look
at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African
writ&#39;n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv &#39;m at it right along, all
the time, amost.  Why, I&#39;d give two dollars to have it read to me; &#39;n&#39;
as for the niggers that wrote it, I &#39;low I&#39;d take &#39;n&#39; lash &#39;m t&#39;ll--&quot;

&quot;People to _help_ him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you&#39;d _think_
so if you&#39;d a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they&#39;ve stole
everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,
mind you. They stole that shirt right off o&#39; the line! and as for that
sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther&#39; ain&#39;t no telling how
many times they _didn&#39;t_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and
candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand
things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and
Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was
a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight
nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they
slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_
but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that
nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs
right on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs
anything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn&#39;t a done better and
been no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_
know our dogs, and ther&#39; ain&#39;t no better; well, them dogs never even got
on the _track_ of &#39;m once!  You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_
of you!&quot;

&quot;Well, it does beat--&quot;

&quot;Laws alive, I never--&quot;

&quot;So help me, I wouldn&#39;t a be--&quot;

&quot;_House_-thieves as well as--&quot;

&quot;Goodnessgracioussakes, I&#39;d a ben afeard to live in sich a--&quot;

&quot;&#39;Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn&#39;t hardly go to bed, or
get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they&#39;d steal
the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was
in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn&#39;t
afraid they&#39;d steal some o&#39; the family!  I was just to that pass I
didn&#39;t have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough
_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there&#39;s my two poor boys
asleep, &#39;way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness
I was that uneasy &#39;t I crep&#39; up there and locked &#39;em in!  I _did_.  And
anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it
keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your
wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o&#39; wild things,
and by and by you think to yourself, spos&#39;n I was a boy, and was away up
there, and the door ain&#39;t locked, and you--&quot; She stopped, looking kind
of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye
lit on me--I got up and took a walk.

Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that
room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.
 So I done it.  But I dasn&#39;t go fur, or she&#39;d a sent for me.  And when
it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
told her the noise and shooting waked up me and &quot;Sid,&quot; and the door was
locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn&#39;t never want to try _that_
no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
before; and then she said she&#39;d forgive us, and maybe it was all right
enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long
as no harm hadn&#39;t come of it, she judged she better put in her time
being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of
fretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted
me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty
soon jumps up, and says:

&quot;Why, lawsamercy, it&#39;s most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_
become of that boy?&quot;

I see my chance; so I skips up and says:

&quot;I&#39;ll run right up to town and get him,&quot; I says.

&quot;No you won&#39;t,&quot; she says.  &quot;You&#39;ll stay right wher&#39; you are; _one&#39;s_
enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain&#39;t here to supper, your uncle &#39;ll
go.&quot;

Well, he warn&#39;t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.

He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn&#39;t run across Tom&#39;s
track. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said
there warn&#39;t no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you&#39;ll
see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had
to be satisfied.  But she said she&#39;d set up for him a while anyway, and
keep a light burning so he could see it.

And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like
I couldn&#39;t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn&#39;t
seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every
now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe
drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or
dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down
silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home
in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,
and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her
good, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she
looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:

&quot;The door ain&#39;t going to be locked, Tom, and there&#39;s the window and
the rod; but you&#39;ll be good, _won&#39;t_ you?  And you won&#39;t go?  For _my_
sake.&quot;

Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
intending to go; but after that I wouldn&#39;t a went, not for kingdoms.

But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around
front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do
something for her, but I couldn&#39;t, only to swear that I wouldn&#39;t never
do nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at
dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,
and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.




CHAPTER XLII.

THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn&#39;t get no
track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
eating anything. And by and by the old man says:

&quot;Did I give you the letter?&quot;

&quot;What letter?&quot;

&quot;The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.&quot;

&quot;No, you didn&#39;t give me no letter.&quot;

&quot;Well, I must a forgot it.&quot;

So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:

&quot;Why, it&#39;s from St. Petersburg--it&#39;s from Sis.&quot;

I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn&#39;t stir.  But
before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
handy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:

&quot;Oh, he&#39;s dead, he&#39;s dead, I know he&#39;s dead!&quot;

And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
which showed he warn&#39;t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
and says:

&quot;He&#39;s alive, thank God!  And that&#39;s enough!&quot; and she snatched a kiss of
him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
could go, every jump of the way.

I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men
was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn&#39;t be trying to run
away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others
said, don&#39;t do it, it wouldn&#39;t answer at all; he ain&#39;t our nigger, and
his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled
them down a little, because the people that&#39;s always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hain&#39;t done just right is always the very
ones that ain&#39;t the most anxious to pay for him when they&#39;ve got their
satisfaction out of him.

They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to
know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes
on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to
a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and
both legs, and said he warn&#39;t to have nothing but bread and water to
eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because
he didn&#39;t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the
cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and
about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with
a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and
takes a look, and says:

&quot;Don&#39;t be no rougher on him than you&#39;re obleeged to, because he ain&#39;t
a bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn&#39;t cut
the bullet out without some help, and he warn&#39;t in no condition for
me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn&#39;t let
me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he&#39;d kill
me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn&#39;t do
anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and
the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says
he&#39;ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I
judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had
to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It
was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
of course I&#39;d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn&#39;t,
because the nigger might get away, and then I&#39;d be to blame; and yet
never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick
plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he&#39;d been worked
main hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I
had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he
would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
_was_, with both of &#39;m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about
dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck
would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped
on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was
about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a
flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and
towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
row nor said a word from the start.  He ain&#39;t no bad nigger, gentlemen;
that&#39;s what I think about him.&quot;

Somebody says:

&quot;Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I&#39;m obleeged to say.&quot;

Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful
to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they
all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out
and hearty, that they wouldn&#39;t cuss him no more.

Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
didn&#39;t think of it, and I reckoned it warn&#39;t best for me to mix in, but
I judged I&#39;d get the doctor&#39;s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
soon as I&#39;d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of
me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger.

But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
him.

Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and
laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding
in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and
set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he&#39;d been sleeping
like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
time, and ten to one he&#39;d wake up in his right mind.

So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:

&quot;Hello!--why, I&#39;m at _home_!  How&#39;s that?  Where&#39;s the raft?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; I says.

&quot;And _Jim_?&quot;

&quot;The same,&quot; I says, but couldn&#39;t say it pretty brash.  But he never
noticed, but says:

&quot;Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we&#39;re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?&quot;

I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  &quot;About what, Sid?&quot;

&quot;Why, about the way the whole thing was done.&quot;

&quot;What whole thing?&quot;

&quot;Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain&#39;t but one; how we set the runaway
nigger free--me and Tom.&quot;

&quot;Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,
out of his head again!&quot;

&quot;_No_, I ain&#39;t out of my _head_; I know all what I&#39;m talking about.  We
_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.
 And we done it elegant, too.&quot;  He&#39;d got a start, and she never checked
him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and
I see it warn&#39;t no use for _me_ to put in.  &quot;Why, Aunty, it cost us a
power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was
all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,
and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the
warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,
and you can&#39;t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and
inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can&#39;t think _half_ the
fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,
and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the
lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder
and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
with in your apron pocket--&quot;

&quot;Mercy sakes!&quot;

&quot;--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for
Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
them go by, and when the dogs come they warn&#39;t interested in us, but
went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by
ourselves, and _wasn&#39;t_ it bully, Aunty!&quot;

&quot;Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was
_you_, you little rapscallions, that&#39;s been making all this trouble,
and turned everybody&#39;s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to
death.  I&#39;ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out
o&#39; you this very minute.  To think, here I&#39;ve been, night after night,
a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I&#39;ll tan the Old
Harry out o&#39; both o&#39; ye!&quot;

But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn&#39;t_ hold in,
and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all
along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
says:

&quot;_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I
tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--&quot;

&quot;Meddling with _who_?&quot;  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
surprised.

&quot;With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who&#39;d you reckon?&quot;

Tom looks at me very grave, and says:

&quot;Tom, didn&#39;t you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn&#39;t he got away?&quot;

&quot;_Him_?&quot; says Aunt Sally; &quot;the runaway nigger?  &#39;Deed he hasn&#39;t.
 They&#39;ve got him back, safe and sound, and he&#39;s in that cabin again,
on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he&#39;s claimed or
sold!&quot;

Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening
and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:

&quot;They hain&#39;t no _right_ to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don&#39;t you lose a
minute.  Turn him loose! he ain&#39;t no slave; he&#39;s as free as any cretur
that walks this earth!&quot;

&quot;What _does_ the child mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don&#39;t go, _I&#39;ll_
go. I&#39;ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss
Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to
sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her
will.&quot;

&quot;Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was
already free?&quot;

&quot;Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,
I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I&#39;d a waded neck-deep in blood
to--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_&quot;

If she warn&#39;t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!

Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,
for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped
out, and in a little while Tom&#39;s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and
stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding
him into the earth, you know.  And then she says:

&quot;Yes, you _better_ turn y&#39;r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.&quot;

&quot;Oh, deary me!&quot; says Aunt Sally; &quot;_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain&#39;t
_Tom_, it&#39;s Sid; Tom&#39;s--Tom&#39;s--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute
ago.&quot;

&quot;You mean where&#39;s Huck _Finn_--that&#39;s what you mean!  I reckon I hain&#39;t
raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I
_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
bed, Huck Finn.&quot;

So I done it.  But not feeling brash.

Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever
see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told
it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn&#39;t
know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
oldest man in the world couldn&#39;t a understood it.  So Tom&#39;s Aunt Polly,
she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how
I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
Sawyer--she chipped in and says, &quot;Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I&#39;m
used to it now, and &#39;tain&#39;t no need to change&quot;--that when Aunt Sally took
me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn&#39;t no other way, and
I knowed he wouldn&#39;t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
a mystery, and he&#39;d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
satisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.

And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn&#39;t
ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.

Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:

&quot;Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all
the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
creetur&#39;s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn&#39;t seem to get any
answer out of you about it.&quot;

&quot;Why, I never heard nothing from you,&quot; says Aunt Sally.

&quot;Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by Sid being here.&quot;

&quot;Well, I never got &#39;em, Sis.&quot;

Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:

&quot;You, Tom!&quot;

&quot;Well--_what_?&quot; he says, kind of pettish.

&quot;Don&#39;t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.&quot;

&quot;What letters?&quot;

&quot;_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I&#39;ll--&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re in the trunk.  There, now.  And they&#39;re just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office.  I hain&#39;t looked into them, I
hain&#39;t touched them.  But I knowed they&#39;d make trouble, and I thought if
you warn&#39;t in no hurry, I&#39;d--&quot;

&quot;Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain&#39;t no mistake about it.  And I
wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s&#39;pose he--&quot;

&quot;No, it come yesterday; I hain&#39;t read it yet, but _it&#39;s_ all right, I&#39;ve
got that one.&quot;

I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn&#39;t, but I reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.




CHAPTER THE LAST

THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
of the evasion?--what it was he&#39;d planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.

We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:

&quot;Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan&#39;?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas&#39;, en what&#39;s de sign un it; en
I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it&#39;s
come true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan&#39; talk to _me_--signs is
_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis&#39; &#39;s well &#39;at I &#39;uz gwineter be
rich agin as I&#39;s a-stannin&#39; heah dis minute!&quot;

And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le&#39;s all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
ain&#39;t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn&#39;t get
none from home, because it&#39;s likely pap&#39;s been back before now, and got
it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.

&quot;No, he hain&#39;t,&quot; Tom says; &quot;it&#39;s all there yet--six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hain&#39;t ever been back since.  Hadn&#39;t when I come
away, anyhow.&quot;

Jim says, kind of solemn:

&quot;He ain&#39;t a-comin&#39; back no mo&#39;, Huck.&quot;

I says:

&quot;Why, Jim?&quot;

&quot;Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain&#39;t comin&#39; back no mo.&quot;

But I kept at him; so at last he says:

&quot;Doan&#39; you &#39;member de house dat was float&#39;n down de river, en dey wuz a
man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn&#39; let you
come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo&#39; money when you wants it, kase dat
wuz him.&quot;

Tom&#39;s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain&#39;t
nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I&#39;d
a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn&#39;t a tackled it,
and ain&#39;t a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the
Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she&#39;s going to adopt me
and sivilize me, and I can&#39;t stand it.  I been there before.

THE END. YOURS TRULY, _HUCK FINN_.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array
of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

CHAPTER ONE

PLAYING PILGRIMS

&quot;Christmas won&#39;t be Christmas without any presents,&quot; grumbled Jo, lying
on the rug.

&quot;It&#39;s so dreadful to be poor!&quot; sighed Meg, looking down at her old
dress.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty
things, and other girls nothing at all,&quot; added little Amy, with an
injured sniff.

&quot;We&#39;ve got Father and Mother, and each other,&quot; said Beth contentedly
from her corner.

The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the
cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, &quot;We haven&#39;t got
Father, and shall not have him for a long time.&quot; She didn&#39;t say
&quot;perhaps never,&quot; but each silently added it, thinking of Father far
away, where the fighting was.

Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, &quot;You know
the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was
because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we
ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in
the army.  We can&#39;t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and
ought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don&#39;t,&quot; and Meg shook her
head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.

&quot;But I don&#39;t think the little we should spend would do any good.  We&#39;ve
each got a dollar, and the army wouldn&#39;t be much helped by our giving
that.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want
to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I&#39;ve wanted it so long,&quot; said
Jo, who was a bookworm.

&quot;I planned to spend mine in new music,&quot; said Beth, with a little sigh,
which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.

&quot;I shall get a nice box of Faber&#39;s drawing pencils; I really need
them,&quot; said Amy decidedly.

&quot;Mother didn&#39;t say anything about our money, and she won&#39;t wish us to
give up everything.  Let&#39;s each buy what we want, and have a little
fun; I&#39;m sure we work hard enough to earn it,&quot; cried Jo, examining the
heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.

&quot;I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I&#39;m
longing to enjoy myself at home,&quot; began Meg, in the complaining tone
again.

&quot;You don&#39;t have half such a hard time as I do,&quot; said Jo. &quot;How would you
like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps
you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you&#39;re ready to
fly out the window or cry?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things
tidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands
get so stiff, I can&#39;t practice well at all.&quot; And Beth looked at her
rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe any of you suffer as I do,&quot; cried Amy, &quot;for you don&#39;t
have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you
don&#39;t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your
father if he isn&#39;t rich, and insult you when your nose isn&#39;t nice.&quot;

&quot;If you mean libel, I&#39;d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa
was a pickle bottle,&quot; advised Jo, laughing.

&quot;I know what I mean, and you needn&#39;t be statirical about it. It&#39;s
proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,&quot; returned Amy,
with dignity.

&quot;Don&#39;t peck at one another, children.  Don&#39;t you wish we had the money
Papa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we&#39;d
be, if we had no worries!&quot; said Meg, who could remember better times.

&quot;You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the
King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in
spite of their money.&quot;

&quot;So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,
we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.&quot;

&quot;Jo does use such slang words!&quot; observed Amy, with a reproving look at
the long figure stretched on the rug.

Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to
whistle.

&quot;Don&#39;t, Jo.  It&#39;s so boyish!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I do it.&quot;

&quot;I detest rude, unladylike girls!&quot;

&quot;I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!&quot;

&quot;Birds in their little nests agree,&quot; sang Beth, the peacemaker, with
such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the
&quot;pecking&quot; ended for that time.

&quot;Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,&quot; said Meg, beginning to
lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. &quot;You are old enough to leave off
boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn&#39;t matter so
much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up
your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I&#39;ll wear it in two
tails till I&#39;m twenty,&quot; cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down
a chestnut mane.  &quot;I hate to think I&#39;ve got to grow up, and be Miss
March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It&#39;s
bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy&#39;s games and work and
manners!  I can&#39;t get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And
it&#39;s worse than ever now, for I&#39;m dying to go and fight with Papa. And
I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!&quot;

And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like
castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.

&quot;Poor Jo!  It&#39;s too bad, but it can&#39;t be helped.  So you must try to be
contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us
girls,&quot; said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the
dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its
touch.

&quot;As for you, Amy,&quot; continued Meg, &quot;you are altogether too particular
and prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you&#39;ll grow up an affected
little goose, if you don&#39;t take care. I like your nice manners and
refined ways of speaking, when you don&#39;t try to be elegant.  But your
absurd words are as bad as Jo&#39;s slang.&quot;

&quot;If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?&quot; asked Beth,
ready to share the lecture.

&quot;You&#39;re a dear, and nothing else,&quot; answered Meg warmly, and no one
contradicted her, for the &#39;Mouse&#39; was the pet of the family.

As young readers like to know &#39;how people look&#39;, we will take this
moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat
knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly
without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable
room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a
good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,
chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a
pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.

Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being
plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet
mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old
Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she
never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very
much in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,
gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,
funny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it
was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders
had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the
uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a
woman and didn&#39;t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,
was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy
manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom
disturbed.  Her father called her &#39;Little Miss Tranquility&#39;, and the
name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of
her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.
Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own
opinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow
hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying
herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters
of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.

The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair
of slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a
good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone
brightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the
lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot
how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the
blaze.

&quot;They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.&quot;

&quot;I thought I&#39;d get her some with my dollar,&quot; said Beth.

&quot;No, I shall!&quot; cried Amy.

&quot;I&#39;m the oldest,&quot; began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, &quot;I&#39;m the man
of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for
he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;ll do,&quot; said Beth, &quot;let&#39;s each get her something
for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s like you, dear!  What will we get?&quot; exclaimed Jo.

Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the
idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, &quot;I shall give
her a nice pair of gloves.&quot;

&quot;Army shoes, best to be had,&quot; cried Jo.

&quot;Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,&quot; said Beth.

&quot;I&#39;ll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won&#39;t cost
much, so I&#39;ll have some left to buy my pencils,&quot; added Amy.

&quot;How will we give the things?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.
Don&#39;t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?&quot; answered Jo.

&quot;I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair
with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the
presents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was
dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,&quot;
said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same
time.

&quot;Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then
surprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so
much to do about the play for Christmas night,&quot; said Jo, marching up
and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.

&quot;I don&#39;t mean to act any more after this time.  I&#39;m getting too old for
such things,&quot; observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about
&#39;dressing-up&#39; frolics.

&quot;You won&#39;t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown
with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best
actress we&#39;ve got, and there&#39;ll be an end of everything if you quit the
boards,&quot; said Jo.  &quot;We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and
do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don&#39;t choose to make
myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down
easily, I&#39;ll drop.  If I can&#39;t, I shall fall into a chair and be
graceful.  I don&#39;t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,&quot;
returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen
because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain
of the piece.

&quot;Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,
crying frantically, &#39;Roderigo! Save me! Save me!&#39;&quot; and away went Jo,
with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.

Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and
jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her &quot;Ow!&quot; was
more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.
Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let
her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. &quot;It&#39;s no use!  Do
the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don&#39;t
blame me.  Come on, Meg.&quot;

Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech
of two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an
awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird
effect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in
agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, &quot;Ha! Ha!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the best we&#39;ve had yet,&quot; said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and
rubbed his elbows.

&quot;I don&#39;t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.
You&#39;re a regular Shakespeare!&quot; exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that
her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.

&quot;Not quite,&quot; replied Jo modestly.  &quot;I do think _The Witches Curse, an
Operatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I&#39;d like to try
_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do
the killing part.  &#39;Is that a dagger that I see before me?&quot; muttered
Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous
tragedian do.

&quot;No, it&#39;s the toasting fork, with Mother&#39;s shoe on it instead of the
bread.  Beth&#39;s stage-struck!&quot; cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a
general burst of laughter.

&quot;Glad to find you so merry, my girls,&quot; said a cheery voice at the door,
and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a
&#39;can I help you&#39; look about her which was truly delightful. She was not
elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the
gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in
the world.

&quot;Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,
getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn&#39;t come home to
dinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look
tired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.&quot;

While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things
off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy
to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The
girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own
way.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,
dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth
trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy
gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.

As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly
happy face, &quot;I&#39;ve got a treat for you after supper.&quot;

A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth
clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up
her napkin, crying, &quot;A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!&quot;

&quot;Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through
the cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving
wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,&quot; said Mrs.
March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.

&quot;Hurry and get done!  Don&#39;t stop to quirk your little finger and simper
over your plate, Amy,&quot; cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her
bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.

Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood
over the delight to come, till the others were ready.

&quot;I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too
old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,&quot; said Meg
warmly.

&quot;Don&#39;t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what&#39;s its name?  Or a
nurse, so I could be near him and help him,&quot; exclaimed Jo, with a groan.

&quot;It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of
bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,&quot; sighed Amy.

&quot;When will he come home, Marmee?&quot; asked Beth, with a little quiver in
her voice.

&quot;Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his
work faithfully as long as he can, and we won&#39;t ask for him back a
minute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.&quot;

They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her
feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on
the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter
should happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those
hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent
home.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the
dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,
hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and
military news, and only at the end did the writer&#39;s heart over-flow
with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.

&quot;Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them
by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their
affection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see
them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these
hard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to
them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty
faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves
so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and
prouder than ever of my little women.&quot; Everybody sniffed when they came
to that part.  Jo wasn&#39;t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the
end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she
hid her face on her mother&#39;s shoulder and sobbed out, &quot;I am a selfish
girl!  But I&#39;ll truly try to be better, so he mayn&#39;t be disappointed in
me by-and-by.&quot;

&quot;We all will,&quot; cried Meg.  &quot;I think too much of my looks and hate to
work, but won&#39;t any more, if I can help it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try and be what he loves to call me, &#39;a little woman&#39; and not be
rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere
else,&quot; said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much
harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.

Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and
began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that
lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all
that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy
coming home.

Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo&#39;s words, by saying in her
cheery voice, &quot;Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress
when you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have
me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and
sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from
the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,
where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a
Celestial City.&quot;

&quot;What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and
passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,&quot; said Jo.

&quot;I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,&quot;
said Meg.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar
and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the
top.  If I wasn&#39;t too old for such things, I&#39;d rather like to play it
over again,&quot; said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things
at the mature age of twelve.

&quot;We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are
playing all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our
road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the
guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace
which is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you
begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can
get before Father comes home.&quot;

&quot;Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?&quot; asked Amy, who was a very
literal young lady.

&quot;Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather
think she hasn&#39;t got any,&quot; said her mother.

&quot;Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice
pianos, and being afraid of people.&quot;

Beth&#39;s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but
nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.

&quot;Let us do it,&quot; said Meg thoughtfully.  &quot;It is only another name for
trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to
be good, it&#39;s hard work and we forget, and don&#39;t do our best.&quot;

&quot;We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled
us out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of
directions, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?&quot; asked Jo,
delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull
task of doing her duty.

&quot;Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your
guidebook,&quot; replied Mrs. March.

They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then
out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the
girls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but
tonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo&#39;s plan of dividing the long
seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,
and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they
talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through
them.

At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.
No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had
a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant
accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a
flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a
cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always
coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the
most pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could
lisp...

    Crinkle, crinkle, &#39;ittle &#39;tar,

and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.
The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the
house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same
cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar
lullaby.



CHAPTER TWO

A MERRY CHRISTMAS

Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No
stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much
disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down
because it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her
mother&#39;s promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a
little crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that
beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it
was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke
Meg with a &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; and bade her see what was under her
pillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,
and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present
very precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage
and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and
all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy
with the coming day.

In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,
which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved
her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently
given.

&quot;Girls,&quot; said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her
to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, &quot;Mother wants
us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.
We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all
this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can
do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a
little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good
and help me through the day.&quot;

Then she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round
her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression
so seldom seen on her restless face.

&quot;How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let&#39;s do as they do.  I&#39;ll help you with
the hard words, and they&#39;ll explain things if we don&#39;t understand,&quot;
whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her
sisters&#39; example.

&quot;I&#39;m glad mine is blue,&quot; said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still
while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to
touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.

&quot;Where is Mother?&quot; asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for
their gifts, half an hour later.

&quot;Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin&#39;, and your ma
went straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman
for givin&#39; away vittles and drink, clothes and firin&#39;,&quot; replied Hannah,
who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by
them all more as a friend than a servant.

&quot;She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything
ready,&quot; said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a
basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper
time.  &quot;Why, where is Amy&#39;s bottle of cologne?&quot; she added, as the
little flask did not appear.

&quot;She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on
it, or some such notion,&quot; replied Jo, dancing about the room to take
the first stiffness off the new army slippers.

&quot;How nice my handkerchiefs look, don&#39;t they?  Hannah washed and ironed
them for me, and I marked them all myself,&quot; said Beth, looking proudly
at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.

&quot;Bless the child!  She&#39;s gone and put &#39;Mother&#39; on them instead of &#39;M.
March&#39;.  How funny!&quot; cried Jo, taking one up.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg&#39;s
initials are M.M., and I don&#39;t want anyone to use these but Marmee,&quot;
said Beth, looking troubled.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for
no one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,&quot;
said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.

&quot;There&#39;s Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!&quot; cried Jo, as a door slammed
and steps sounded in the hall.

Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters
all waiting for her.

&quot;Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?&quot; asked Meg,
surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so
early.

&quot;Don&#39;t laugh at me, Jo!  I didn&#39;t mean anyone should know till the time
came.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I
gave all my money to get it, and I&#39;m truly trying not to be selfish any
more.&quot;

As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget
herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her &#39;a
trump&#39;, while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to
ornament the stately bottle.

&quot;You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about
being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
minute I was up, and I&#39;m so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.&quot;

Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
girls to the table, eager for breakfast.

&quot;Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We
read some, and mean to every day,&quot; they all cried in chorus.

&quot;Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I&#39;m glad you began at once, and
hope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.
Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.
Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they
have no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy
came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will
you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?&quot;

They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a
minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, &quot;I&#39;m
so glad you came before we began!&quot;

&quot;May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?&quot; asked
Beth eagerly.

&quot;I shall take the cream and the muffings,&quot; added Amy, heroically giving
up the article she most liked.

Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one
big plate.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d do it,&quot; said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. &quot;You
shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and
milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.&quot;

They were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was
early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and
no one laughed at the queer party.

A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,
ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,
hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.

How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.

&quot;Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!&quot; said the poor woman,
crying for joy.

&quot;Funny angels in hoods and mittens,&quot; said Jo, and set them to laughing.

In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work
there.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the
broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the
mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while
she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The
girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and
fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to
understand the funny broken English.

&quot;Das ist gut!&quot;  &quot;Die Engel-kinder!&quot; cried the poor things as they ate
and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had
never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,
especially Jo, who had been considered a &#39;Sancho&#39; ever since she was
born.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn&#39;t get any of
it.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there
were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little
girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with
bread and milk on Christmas morning.

&quot;That&#39;s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,&quot; said
Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs
collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.

Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in
the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white
chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave
quite an elegant air to the table.

&quot;She&#39;s coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for
Marmee!&quot; cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to
the seat of honor.

Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted
escort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,
and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the
little notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a
new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy&#39;s
cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were
pronounced a perfect fit.

There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the
simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at
the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to
work.

The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of
the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being
still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to
afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their
wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made
whatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,
pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats
covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering
with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the
same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of
preserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many
innocent revels.

No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart&#39;s
content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots
given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,
an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some
picture, were Jo&#39;s chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The
smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors
to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit
for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,
whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage
besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless
amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been
idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.

On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the
dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a
most flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling
and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an
occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the
excitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew
apart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.

&quot;A gloomy wood,&quot; according to the one playbill, was represented by a
few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the
distance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus
for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black
pot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the
glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued
from the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was
allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,
stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black
beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in
much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,
singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing
resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo&#39;s
voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were
very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for
breath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he
stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,
&quot;What ho, minion! I need thee!&quot;

Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and
black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo
demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.
Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call
up the spirit who would bring the love philter.

    Hither, hither, from thy home,
    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!
    Born of roses, fed on dew,
    Charms and potions canst thou brew?
    Bring me here, with elfin speed,
    The fragrant philter which I need.
    Make it sweet and swift and strong,
    Spirit, answer now my song!

A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave
appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden
hair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...

    Hither I come,
    From my airy home,
    Afar in the silver moon.
    Take the magic spell,
    And use it well,
    Or its power will vanish soon!

And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch&#39;s feet, the spirit
vanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a
lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having
croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a
mocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his
boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had
killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and
intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain
fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the
merits of the play.

A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but
when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been
got up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower
rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning
in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and
silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with
plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of
course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in
melting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented
to fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a
rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara
to descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on
Roderigo&#39;s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when &quot;Alas!
Alas for Zara!&quot; she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the
tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the
unhappy lovers in the ruins.

A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the
wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, &quot;I told you so!  I told
you so!&quot;  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,
rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...

&quot;Don&#39;t laugh!  Act as if it was all right!&quot; and, ordering Roderigo up,
banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly
shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old
gentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She
also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons
of the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led
them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the
speech he ought to have made.

Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to
free the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees
him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little
servant, &quot;Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I
shall come anon.&quot;  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,
and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.
Ferdinando, the &#39;minion&#39;, carries them away, and Hagar puts back the
cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty
after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal
of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him
what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.

This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have
thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair
rather marred the effect of the villain&#39;s death.  He was called before
the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose
singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the
performance put together.

Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing
himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as
the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,
informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if
he will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of
rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his
lady love.

Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He
wishes her to go into a convent, but she won&#39;t hear of it, and after a
touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands
her hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and
gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear
away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter
and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter
informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair
and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn&#39;t make them happy.  The bag
is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage
till it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the
stern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,
and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro&#39;s
blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.

Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the
cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and
extinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to
the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless
with laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah
appeared, with &quot;Mrs. March&#39;s compliments, and would the ladies walk
down to supper.&quot;

This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,
they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee
to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was
unheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,
actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and
distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great
bouquets of hot house flowers.

It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and
then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.

&quot;Is it fairies?&quot; asked Amy.

&quot;Santa Claus,&quot; said Beth.

&quot;Mother did it.&quot; And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray
beard and white eyebrows.

&quot;Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,&quot; cried Jo, with a
sudden inspiration.

&quot;All wrong.  Old Mr. Laurence sent it,&quot; replied Mrs. March.

&quot;The Laurence boy&#39;s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing
into his head?  We don&#39;t know him!&quot; exclaimed Meg.

&quot;Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an
odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.  He knew my father years ago,
and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would
allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending
them a few trifles in honor of the day.  I could not refuse, and so you
have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk
breakfast.&quot;

&quot;That boy put it into his head, I know he did!  He&#39;s a capital fellow,
and I wish we could get acquainted.  He looks as if he&#39;d like to know
us but he&#39;s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won&#39;t let me speak to him
when we pass,&quot; said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to
melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.

&quot;You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don&#39;t you?&quot;
asked one of the girls.  &quot;My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says
he&#39;s very proud and doesn&#39;t like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps
his grandson shut up, when he isn&#39;t riding or walking with his tutor,
and makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he
didn&#39;t come.  Mother says he&#39;s very nice, though he never speaks to us
girls.&quot;

&quot;Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the
fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,
when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.  I mean to know him some day,
for he needs fun, I&#39;m sure he does,&quot; said Jo decidedly.

&quot;I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I&#39;ve no
objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He
brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had
been sure what was going on upstairs.  He looked so wistful as he went
away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a mercy you didn&#39;t, Mother!&quot; laughed Jo, looking at her boots.
&quot;But we&#39;ll have another play sometime that he can see.  Perhaps he&#39;ll
help act.  Wouldn&#39;t that be jolly?&quot;

&quot;I never had such a fine bouquet before!  How pretty it is!&quot; And Meg
examined her flowers with great interest.

&quot;They are lovely.  But Beth&#39;s roses are sweeter to me,&quot; said Mrs.
March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.

Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, &quot;I wish I could send my
bunch to Father.  I&#39;m afraid he isn&#39;t having such a merry Christmas as
we are.&quot;



CHAPTER THREE

THE LAURENCE BOY

&quot;Jo!  Jo!  Where are you?&quot; cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.

&quot;Here!&quot; answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found
her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped
up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.
This was Jo&#39;s favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a
dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a
pet rat who lived near by and didn&#39;t mind her a particle.  As Meg
appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.  Jo shook the tears off her
cheeks and waited to hear the news.

&quot;Such fun!  Only see!  A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner
for tomorrow night!&quot; cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then
proceeding to read it with girlish delight.

&quot;&#39;Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at
a little dance on New Year&#39;s Eve.&#39; Marmee is willing we should go, now
what shall we wear?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our
poplins, because we haven&#39;t got anything else?&quot; answered Jo with her
mouth full.

&quot;If I only had a silk!&quot; sighed Meg.  &quot;Mother says I may when I&#39;m
eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.
Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.
Whatever shall I do?  The burn shows badly, and I can&#39;t take any out.&quot;

&quot;You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The
front is all right.  I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee
will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and
my gloves will do, though they aren&#39;t as nice as I&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can&#39;t get any new ones, so I
shall have to go without,&quot; said Jo, who never troubled herself much
about dress.

&quot;You must have gloves, or I won&#39;t go,&quot; cried Meg decidedly. &quot;Gloves are
more important than anything else.  You can&#39;t dance without them, and
if you don&#39;t I should be so mortified.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll stay still.  I don&#39;t care much for company dancing. It&#39;s no
fun to go sailing round.  I like to fly about and cut capers.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are
so careless.  She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn&#39;t
get you any more this winter.  Can&#39;t you make them do?&quot;

&quot;I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how
stained they are.  That&#39;s all I can do.  No!  I&#39;ll tell you how we can
manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.  Don&#39;t you see?&quot;

&quot;Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove
dreadfully,&quot; began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll go without.  I don&#39;t care what people say!&quot; cried Jo, taking
up her book.

&quot;You may have it, you may!  Only don&#39;t stain it, and do behave nicely.
Don&#39;t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say &#39;Christopher
Columbus!&#39; will you?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me.  I&#39;ll be as prim as I can and not get into any
scrapes, if I can help it.  Now go and answer your note, and let me
finish this splendid story.&quot;

So Meg went away to &#39;accept with thanks&#39;, look over her dress, and sing
blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her
story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.

On New Year&#39;s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls
played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the
all-important business of &#39;getting ready for the party&#39;.  Simple as the
toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing
and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the
house.  Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to
pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.

&quot;Ought they to smoke like that?&quot; asked Beth from her perch on the bed.

&quot;It&#39;s the dampness drying,&quot; replied Jo.

&quot;What a queer smell!  It&#39;s like burned feathers,&quot; observed Amy,
smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.

&quot;There, now I&#39;ll take off the papers and you&#39;ll see a cloud of little
ringlets,&quot; said Jo, putting down the tongs.

She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the
hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of
little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.

&quot;Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?  I&#39;m spoiled!  I can&#39;t go!  My hair,
oh, my hair!&quot; wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on
her forehead.

&quot;Just my luck!  You shouldn&#39;t have asked me to do it.  I always spoil
everything.  I&#39;m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I&#39;ve made
a mess,&quot; groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with
tears of regret.

&quot;It isn&#39;t spoiled.  Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends
come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion.
I&#39;ve seen many girls do it so,&quot; said Amy consolingly.

&quot;Serves me right for trying to be fine.  I wish I&#39;d let my hair alone,&quot;
cried Meg petulantly.

&quot;So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.  But it will soon grow out
again,&quot; said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.

After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the
united exertions of the entire family Jo&#39;s hair was got up and her
dress on.  They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg&#39;s in
silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.
Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white
chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light
glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect &quot;quite
easy and fine&quot;.  Meg&#39;s high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt
her, though she would not own it, and Jo&#39;s nineteen hairpins all seemed
stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,
dear me, let us be elegant or die.

&quot;Have a good time, dearies!&quot; said Mrs. March, as the sisters went
daintily down the walk.  &quot;Don&#39;t eat much supper, and come away at
eleven when I send Hannah for you.&quot;  As the gate clashed behind them, a
voice cried from a window...

&quot;Girls, girls!  Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,&quot; cried Jo, adding
with a laugh as they went on, &quot;I do believe Marmee would ask that if we
were all running away from an earthquake.&quot;

&quot;It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real
lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,&quot; replied
Meg, who had a good many little &#39;aristocratic tastes&#39; of her own.

&quot;Now don&#39;t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash
right?  And does my hair look very bad?&quot; said Meg, as she turned from
the glass in Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s dressing room after a prolonged prink.

&quot;I know I shall forget.  If you see me doing anything wrong, just
remind me by a wink, will you?&quot; returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch
and her head a hasty brush.

&quot;No, winking isn&#39;t ladylike.  I&#39;ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is
wrong, and nod if you are all right.  Now hold your shoulder straight,
and take short steps, and don&#39;t shake hands if you are introduced to
anyone.  It isn&#39;t the thing.&quot;

&quot;How do you learn all the proper ways?  I never can.  Isn&#39;t that music
gay?&quot;

Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to
parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to
them.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and
handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie
and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn&#39;t care much for girls
or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the
wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.  Half
a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the
room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the
joys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows
went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.  No one came to talk to
her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.
She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth
would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing
began.  Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so
briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered
smilingly.  Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and
fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess,
intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.  Unfortunately, another
bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell
behind her, she found herself face to face with the &#39;Laurence boy&#39;.

&quot;Dear me, I didn&#39;t know anyone was here!&quot; stammered Jo, preparing to
back out as speedily as she had bounced in.

But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little
startled, &quot;Don&#39;t mind me, stay if you like.&quot;

&quot;Shan&#39;t I disturb you?&quot;

&quot;Not a bit.  I only came here because I don&#39;t know many people and felt
rather strange at first, you know.&quot;

&quot;So did I.  Don&#39;t go away, please, unless you&#39;d rather.&quot;

The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to
be polite and easy, &quot;I think I&#39;ve had the pleasure of seeing you
before.  You live near us, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Next door.&quot;  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo&#39;s prim
manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about
cricket when he brought the cat home.

That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her
heartiest way, &quot;We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas
present.&quot;

&quot;Grandpa sent it.&quot;

&quot;But you put it into his head, didn&#39;t you, now?&quot;

&quot;How is your cat, Miss March?&quot; asked the boy, trying to look sober
while his black eyes shone with fun.

&quot;Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.  But I am not Miss March, I&#39;m only
Jo,&quot; returned the young lady.

&quot;I&#39;m not Mr. Laurence, I&#39;m only Laurie.&quot;

&quot;Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.&quot;

&quot;My first name is Theodore, but I don&#39;t like it, for the fellows called
me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.&quot;

&quot;I hate my name, too, so sentimental!  I wish every one would say Jo
instead of Josephine.  How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?&quot;

&quot;I thrashed &#39;em.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.&quot;  And
Jo resigned herself with a sigh.

&quot;Don&#39;t you like to dance, Miss Jo?&quot; asked Laurie, looking as if he
thought the name suited her.

&quot;I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is
lively.  In a place like this I&#39;m sure to upset something, tread on
people&#39;s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and
let Meg sail about.  Don&#39;t you dance?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes.  You see I&#39;ve been abroad a good many years, and haven&#39;t
been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.&quot;

&quot;Abroad!&quot; cried Jo.  &quot;Oh, tell me about it!  I love dearly to hear
people describe their travels.&quot;

Laurie didn&#39;t seem to know where to begin, but Jo&#39;s eager questions
soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay,
where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,
and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their
teachers.

&quot;Don&#39;t I wish I&#39;d been there!&quot; cried Jo.  &quot;Did you go to Paris?&quot;

&quot;We spent last winter there.&quot;

&quot;Can you talk French?&quot;

&quot;We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.&quot;

&quot;Do say some!  I can read it, but can&#39;t pronounce.&quot;

&quot;Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?&quot;

&quot;How nicely you do it!  Let me see ... you said, &#39;Who is the young lady
in the pretty slippers&#39;, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Oui, mademoiselle.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!  Do you think she is
pretty?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and
quiet, and dances like a lady.&quot;

Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and
stored it up to repeat to Meg.  Both peeped and criticized and chatted
till they felt like old acquaintances.  Laurie&#39;s bashfulness soon wore
off, for Jo&#39;s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and
Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody
lifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the &#39;Laurence boy&#39; better than
ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him
to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys
were almost unknown creatures to them.

&quot;Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine
teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,
and altogether jolly.  Wonder how old he is?&quot;

It was on the tip of Jo&#39;s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in
time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.

&quot;I suppose you are going to college soon?  I see you pegging away at
your books, no, I mean studying hard.&quot;  And Jo blushed at the dreadful
&#39;pegging&#39; which had escaped her.

Laurie smiled but didn&#39;t seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  &quot;Not
for a year or two.  I won&#39;t go before seventeen, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you but fifteen?&quot; asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she
had imagined seventeen already.

&quot;Sixteen, next month.&quot;

&quot;How I wish I was going to college!  You don&#39;t look as if you liked it.&quot;

&quot;I hate it!  Nothing but grinding or skylarking.  And I don&#39;t like the
way fellows do either, in this country.&quot;

&quot;What do you like?&quot;

&quot;To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.&quot;

Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows
looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject
by saying, as her foot kept time, &quot;That&#39;s a splendid polka!  Why don&#39;t
you go and try it?&quot;

&quot;If you will come too,&quot; he answered, with a gallant little bow.

&quot;I can&#39;t, for I told Meg I wouldn&#39;t, because...&quot; There Jo stopped, and
looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.

&quot;Because, what?&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t tell?&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot;

&quot;Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my
frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it&#39;s nicely mended, it
shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.  You may
laugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I know.&quot;

But Laurie didn&#39;t laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the
expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, &quot;Never mind
that.  I&#39;ll tell you how we can manage.  There&#39;s a long hall out there,
and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.&quot;

Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when
she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was
empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught
her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and
spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get
their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students&#39;
festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She
beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she
found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.

&quot;I&#39;ve sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a
sad wrench.  It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m
ever going to get home,&quot; she said, rocking to and fro in pain.

&quot;I knew you&#39;d hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I&#39;m sorry.  But I
don&#39;t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all
night,&quot; answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.

&quot;I can&#39;t have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say
I can&#39;t get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it&#39;s a
long way to the stable, and no one to send.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go.&quot;

&quot;No, indeed!  It&#39;s past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can&#39;t stop here,
for the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I&#39;ll
rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll ask Laurie.  He will go,&quot; said Jo, looking relieved as the idea
occurred to her.

&quot;Mercy, no!  Don&#39;t ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put
these slippers with our things.  I can&#39;t dance anymore, but as soon as
supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.&quot;

&quot;They are going out to supper now.  I&#39;ll stay with you.  I&#39;d rather.&quot;

&quot;No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I&#39;m so tired I can&#39;t
stir.&quot;

So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away
to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,
and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a
little private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured
the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of
her dress as bad as the back.

&quot;Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!&quot; exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg&#39;s
glove by scrubbing her gown with it.

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; said a friendly voice.  And there was Laurie, with a
full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.

&quot;I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone
shook me, and here I am in a nice state,&quot; answered Jo, glancing
dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.

&quot;Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it
to your sister?&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you!  I&#39;ll show you where she is.  I don&#39;t offer to take it
myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.&quot;

Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a
little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,
and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a &#39;nice
boy&#39;.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in
the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young
people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot
and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an
exclamation of pain.

&quot;Hush!  Don&#39;t say anything,&quot; she whispered, adding aloud, &quot;It&#39;s
nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that&#39;s all,&quot; and limped upstairs
to put her things on.

Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits&#39; end, till she
decided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down
and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It
happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood
and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she
said, came up and offered his grandfather&#39;s carriage, which had just
come for him, he said.

&quot;It&#39;s so early!  You can&#39;t mean to go yet?&quot; began Jo, looking relieved
but hesitating to accept the offer.

&quot;I always go early, I do, truly!  Please let me take you home. It&#39;s all
on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.&quot;

That settled it, and telling him of Meg&#39;s mishap, Jo gratefully
accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.  Hannah
hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they
rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and
elegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the
girls talked over their party in freedom.

&quot;I had a capital time.  Did you?&quot; asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and
making herself comfortable.

&quot;Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie&#39;s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy
to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does.
She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be
perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,&quot; answered Meg, cheering
up at the thought.

&quot;I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.  Was he
nice?&quot;

&quot;Oh, very!  His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I
had a delicious redowa with him.&quot;

&quot;He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie
and I couldn&#39;t help laughing.  Did you hear us?&quot;

&quot;No, but it was very rude.  What were you about all that time, hidden
away there?&quot;

Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at
home.  With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to
disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little
nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...

&quot;Tell about the party!  Tell about the party!&quot;

With what Meg called &#39;a great want of manners&#39; Jo had saved some
bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the
most thrilling events of the evening.

&quot;I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home
from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to
wait on me,&quot; said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed
her hair.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we
do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight
slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.&quot;
And I think Jo was quite right.



CHAPTER FOUR

BURDENS

&quot;Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,&quot;
sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over,
the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the
task she never liked.

&quot;I wish it was Christmas or New Year&#39;s all the time. Wouldn&#39;t it be
fun?&quot; answered Jo, yawning dismally.

&quot;We shouldn&#39;t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does
seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,
and drive home, and read and rest, and not work.  It&#39;s like other
people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I&#39;m so
fond of luxury,&quot; said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns
was the least shabby.

&quot;Well, we can&#39;t have it, so don&#39;t let us grumble but shoulder our
bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does.  I&#39;m sure Aunt
March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I&#39;ve
learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get
so light that I shan&#39;t mind her.&quot;

This idea tickled Jo&#39;s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg
didn&#39;t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children,
seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself
pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair
in the most becoming way.

&quot;Where&#39;s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross
midgets, and no one cares whether I&#39;m pretty or not?&quot; she muttered,
shutting her drawer with a jerk.  &quot;I shall have to toil and moil all my
days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly
and sour, because I&#39;m poor and can&#39;t enjoy my life as other girls do.
It&#39;s a shame!&quot;

So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn&#39;t at all agreeable
at breakfast time.  Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to
croak.

Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with
the cat and three kittens.  Amy was fretting because her lessons were
not learned, and she couldn&#39;t find her rubbers.  Jo would whistle and
make a great racket getting ready.

Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at
once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn&#39;t suit her.

&quot;There never was such a cross family!&quot; cried Jo, losing her temper when
she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon
her hat.

&quot;You&#39;re the crossest person in it!&quot; returned Amy, washing out the sum
that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.

&quot;Beth, if you don&#39;t keep these horrid cats down cellar I&#39;ll have them
drowned,&quot; exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten
which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.

Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she
couldn&#39;t remember how much nine times twelve was.

&quot;Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!  I must get this off by the
early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,&quot; cried Mrs.
March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.

There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two
hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were
an institution, and the girls called them &#39;muffs&#39;, for they had no
others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold
mornings.

Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she
might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other
lunch and were seldom home before two.

&quot;Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee.
We are a set of rascals this morning, but we&#39;ll come home regular
angels.  Now then, Meg!&quot;  And Jo tramped away, feeling that the
pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.

They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was
always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.
Somehow it seemed as if they couldn&#39;t have got through the day without
that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that
motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.

&quot;If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would
serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never
seen,&quot; cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and
bitter wind.

&quot;Don&#39;t use such dreadful expressions,&quot; replied Meg from the depths of
the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.

&quot;I like good strong words that mean something,&quot; replied Jo, catching
her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away
altogether.

&quot;Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a
wretch and I don&#39;t choose to be called so.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can&#39;t
sit in the lap of luxury all the time.  Poor dear, just wait till I
make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and
high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.&quot;

&quot;How ridiculous you are, Jo!&quot;  But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt
better in spite of herself.

&quot;Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be
dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can
always find something funny to keep me up.  Don&#39;t croak any more, but
come home jolly, there&#39;s a dear.&quot;

Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted
for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm
turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,
hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.

When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate
friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something
toward their own support, at least.  Believing that they could not
begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their
parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will
which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.

Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her
small salary.  As she said, she was &#39;fond of luxury&#39;, and her chief
trouble was poverty.  She found it harder to bear than the others
because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of
ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown.  She tried not to be
envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl
should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a
happy life.  At the Kings&#39; she daily saw all she wanted, for the
children&#39;s older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent
glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about
theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds,
and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to
her.  Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her
feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to
know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.

Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active
person to wait upon her.  The childless old lady had offered to adopt
one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because
her offer was declined.  Other friends told the Marches that they had
lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady&#39;s will, but
the unworldly Marches only said...

&quot;We can&#39;t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.  Rich or poor, we
will keep together and be happy in one another.&quot;

The old lady wouldn&#39;t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet
Jo at a friend&#39;s, something in her comical face and blunt manners
struck the old lady&#39;s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a
companion.  This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place
since nothing better appeared and, to every one&#39;s surprise, got on
remarkably well with her irascible relative.  There was an occasional
tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn&#39;t bear it
longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to
come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her
heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.

I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,
which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died.  Jo
remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads
and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer
pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever
he met her in the street.  The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring
down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of
all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked,
made the library a region of bliss to her.

The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo
hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair,
devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular
bookworm.  But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure
as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a
song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice
called, &quot;Josy-phine! Josy-phine!&quot; and she had to leave her paradise to
wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham&#39;s Essays by the hour
together.

Jo&#39;s ambition was to do something very splendid.  What it was, she had
no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found
her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn&#39;t read, run, and
ride as much as she liked.  A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless
spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series
of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training
she received at Aunt March&#39;s was just what she needed, and the thought
that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite
of the perpetual &quot;Josy-phine!&quot;

Beth was too bashful to go to school.  It had been tried, but she
suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home
with her father.  Even when he went away, and her mother was called to
devote her skill and energy to Soldiers&#39; Aid Societies, Beth went
faithfully on by herself and did the best she could.  She was a
housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and
comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be
loved.  Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little
world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy
bee.  There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning,
for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever.  Not one
whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them
in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her
because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the
more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm
dolls.  No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh
words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart
of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and
caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of
dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was
left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued
by Beth and taken to her refuge.  Having no top to its head, she tied
on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid
these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed
to this chronic invalid.  If anyone had known the care lavished on that
dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they
laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out
to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and
never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering
tenderly, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll have a good night, my poor dear.&quot;

Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but
a very human little girl, she often &#39;wept a little weep&#39; as Jo said,
because she couldn&#39;t take music lessons and have a fine piano.  She
loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so
patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if
someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.  Nobody did,
however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that
wouldn&#39;t keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little
lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and
day after day said hopefully to herself, &quot;I know I&#39;ll get my music some
time, if I&#39;m good.&quot;

There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners
till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the
sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and
the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow
behind.

If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she
would have answered at once, &quot;My nose.&quot;  When she was a baby, Jo had
accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the
fall had ruined her nose forever.  It was not big nor red, like poor
&#39;Petrea&#39;s&#39;, it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world
could not give it an aristocratic point.  No one minded it but herself,
and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a
Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.

&quot;Little Raphael,&quot; as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for
drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing
fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art.  Her
teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her
slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps
on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering
out of all her books at unlucky moments.  She got through her lessons
as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model
of deportment.  She was a great favorite with her mates, being
good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.
Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her
accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,
crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of
the words.  She had a plaintive way of saying, &quot;When Papa was rich we
did so-and-so,&quot; which was very touching, and her long words were
considered &#39;perfectly elegant&#39; by the girls.

Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her
small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,
however, rather quenched the vanities.  She had to wear her cousin&#39;s
clothes.  Now Florence&#39;s mama hadn&#39;t a particle of taste, and Amy
suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,
unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.  Everything was
good, well made, and little worn, but Amy&#39;s artistic eyes were much
afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull
purple with yellow dots and no trimming.

&quot;My only comfort,&quot; she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, &quot;is that
Mother doesn&#39;t take tucks in my dresses whenever I&#39;m naughty, as Maria
Parks&#39;s mother does.  My dear, it&#39;s really dreadful, for sometimes she
is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can&#39;t come to school.
When I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my
flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.&quot;

Meg was Amy&#39;s confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of
opposites Jo was gentle Beth&#39;s.  To Jo alone did the shy child tell her
thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously
exercised more influence than anyone in the family.  The two older
girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the
younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way,
&#39;playing mother&#39; they called it, and put their sisters in the places of
discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.

&quot;Has anybody got anything to tell?  It&#39;s been such a dismal day I&#39;m
really dying for some amusement,&quot; said Meg, as they sat sewing together
that evening.

&quot;I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I&#39;ll
tell you about it,&quot; began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories.  &quot;I was
reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for
Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like
fury till she wakes up.  I actually made myself sleepy, and before she
began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by
opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.&quot;

&quot;I wish I could, and be done with it,&quot; said I, trying not to be saucy.

&quot;Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and
think them over while she just &#39;lost&#39; herself for a moment. She never
finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a
top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the _Vicar of Wakefield_ out of my pocket,
and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I&#39;d just got to
where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out
loud.  Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me
to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy
and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though
she only said...

&quot;&#39;I don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s all about.  Go back and begin it,
child.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.
Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,
&#39;I&#39;m afraid it tires you, ma&#39;am.  Shan&#39;t I stop now?&#39;&quot;

&quot;She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave
me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, &#39;Finish
the chapter, and don&#39;t be impertinent, miss&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Did she own she liked it?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;Oh, bless you, no!  But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back
after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar
that she didn&#39;t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of
the good time coming.  What a pleasant life she might have if only she
chose!  I don&#39;t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all
rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,&quot; added Jo.

&quot;That reminds me,&quot; said Meg, &quot;that I&#39;ve got something to tell. It isn&#39;t
funny, like Jo&#39;s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came
home.  At the Kings&#39; today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of
the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful,
and Papa had sent him away.  I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King
talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when
they passed me, so I shouldn&#39;t see how red and swollen their eyes were.
I didn&#39;t ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and
was rather glad I hadn&#39;t any wild brothers to do wicked things and
disgrace the family.&quot;

&quot;I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than
anything bad boys can do,&quot; said Amy, shaking her head, as if her
experience of life had been a deep one.  &quot;Susie Perkins came to school
today with a lovely red carnelian ring.  I wanted it dreadfully, and
wished I was her with all my might.  Well, she drew a picture of Mr.
Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, &#39;Young ladies,
my eye is upon you!&#39; coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing.  We
were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he
ordered Susie to bring up her slate.  She was _parry_lized with fright,
but she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did?  He took her by the
ear--the ear!  Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation
platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so
everyone could see.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t the girls laugh at the picture?&quot; asked Jo, who relished the
scrape.

&quot;Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know
she did.  I didn&#39;t envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian
rings wouldn&#39;t have made me happy after that. I never, never should
have got over such a agonizing mortification.&quot; And Amy went on with her
work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance
of two long words in a breath.

&quot;I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at
dinner, but I forgot,&quot; said Beth, putting Jo&#39;s topsy-turvy basket in
order as she talked.  &quot;When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.
Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn&#39;t see me, for I kept behind
the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor
woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would
let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn&#39;t any
dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day&#39;s work.
Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said &#39;No&#39;, rather crossly, so she was
going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big
fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her.  She was
so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him
over and over.  He told her to &#39;go along and cook it&#39;, and she hurried
off, so happy!  Wasn&#39;t it good of him?  Oh, she did look so funny,
hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence&#39;s bed in heaven
would be &#39;aisy&#39;.&quot;

When they had laughed at Beth&#39;s story, they asked their mother for one,
and after a moments thought, she said soberly, &quot;As I sat cutting out
blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about
Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything
happened to him.  It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying
till an old man came in with an order for some clothes.  He sat down
near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and
anxious.

&quot;&#39;Have you sons in the army?&#39; I asked, for the note he brought was not
to me.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.  I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and
I&#39;m going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.&#39; he
answered quietly.&quot;

&quot;&#39;You have done a great deal for your country, sir,&#39; I said, feeling
respect now, instead of pity.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Not a mite more than I ought, ma&#39;am.  I&#39;d go myself, if I was any
use.  As I ain&#39;t, I give my boys, and give &#39;em free.&#39;&quot;

&quot;He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give
his all, that I was ashamed of myself.  I&#39;d given one man and thought
it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.  I had all my
girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away,
to say good-by to him, perhaps!  I felt so rich, so happy thinking of
my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and
thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.&quot;

&quot;Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like
to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,&quot;
said Jo, after a minute&#39;s silence.

Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this
little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.

&quot;Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and
drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and
parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.&quot; (Here
the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew
diligently.) &quot;These girls were anxious to be good and made many
excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were
constantly saying, &#39;If only we had this,&#39; or &#39;If we could only do
that,&#39; quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things
they actually could do.  So they asked an old woman what spell they
could use to make them happy, and she said, &#39;When you feel
discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.&#39;&quot; (Here Jo
looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing
that the story was not done yet.)

&quot;Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were
surprised to see how well off they were.  One discovered that money
couldn&#39;t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people&#39;s houses, another
that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her
youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old
lady who couldn&#39;t enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it
was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and
the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good
behavior.  So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings
already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken
away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never
disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman&#39;s advice.&quot;

&quot;Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories
against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!&quot; cried Meg.

&quot;I like that kind of sermon.  It&#39;s the sort Father used to tell us,&quot;
said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo&#39;s cushion.

&quot;I don&#39;t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more
careful than ever now, for I&#39;ve had warning from Susie&#39;s downfall,&quot;
said Amy morally.

&quot;We needed that lesson, and we won&#39;t forget it.  If we do so, you just
say to us, as old Chloe did in _Uncle Tom_, &#39;Tink ob yer marcies,
chillen!&#39; &#39;Tink ob yer marcies!&#39;&quot; added Jo, who could not, for the life
of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though
she took it to heart as much as any of them.



CHAPTER FIVE

BEING NEIGHBORLY

&quot;What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?&quot; asked Meg one snowy
afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber
boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the
other.

&quot;Going out for exercise,&quot; answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her
eyes.

&quot;I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!
It&#39;s cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the
fire, as I do,&quot; said Meg with a shiver.

&quot;Never take advice!  Can&#39;t keep still all day, and not being a
pussycat, I don&#39;t like to doze by the fire.  I like adventures, and I&#39;m
going to find some.&quot;

Meg went back to toast her feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig
paths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she
soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the
sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden
separated the Marches&#39; house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in
a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and
lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two
estates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and
shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the
flowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately
stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,
from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and
the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.

Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children
frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and
few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.

To Jo&#39;s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted
palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had
long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence
boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to
begin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had
planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen
lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied
a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their
garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.

&quot;That boy is suffering for society and fun,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;His
grandpa does not know what&#39;s good for him, and keeps him shut up all
alone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young
and lively.  I&#39;ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman
so!&quot;

The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always
scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.  The plan of &#39;going over&#39;
was not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to
try what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then
sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took
a survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out
of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a
thin hand at the upper window.

&quot;There he is,&quot; thought Jo, &quot;Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal
day.  It&#39;s a shame!  I&#39;ll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and
then say a kind word to him.&quot;

Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a
face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes
brightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and
flourished her broom as she called out...

&quot;How do you do?  Are you sick?&quot;

Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...

&quot;Better, thank you.  I&#39;ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  What do you amuse yourself with?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.  It&#39;s dull as tombs up here.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you read?&quot;

&quot;Not much.  They won&#39;t let me.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t somebody read to you?&quot;

&quot;Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don&#39;t interest him, and I hate to
ask Brooke all the time.&quot;

&quot;Have someone come and see you then.&quot;

&quot;There isn&#39;t anyone I&#39;d like to see.  Boys make such a row, and my head
is weak.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t there some nice girl who&#39;d read and amuse you?  Girls are quiet
and like to play nurse.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know any.&quot;

&quot;You know us,&quot; began Jo, then laughed and stopped.

&quot;So I do!  Will you come, please?&quot; cried Laurie.

&quot;I&#39;m not quiet and nice, but I&#39;ll come, if Mother will let me. I&#39;ll go
ask her.  Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.&quot;

With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,
wondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of
excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,
for as Mrs. March said, he was &#39;a little gentleman&#39;, and did honor to
the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color,
and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen
servants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,
than a decided voice, asking for &#39;Mr. Laurie&#39;, and a surprised-looking
servant came running up to announce a young lady.

&quot;All right, show her up, it&#39;s Miss Jo,&quot; said Laurie, going to the door
of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite
at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth&#39;s three kittens
in the other.

&quot;Here I am, bag and baggage,&quot; she said briskly.  &quot;Mother sent her love,
and was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring
some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her
cats would be comforting.  I knew you&#39;d laugh at them, but I couldn&#39;t
refuse, she was so anxious to do something.&quot;

It so happened that Beth&#39;s funny loan was just the thing, for in
laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew
sociable at once.

&quot;That looks too pretty to eat,&quot; he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo
uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland
of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy&#39;s pet geranium.

&quot;It isn&#39;t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.
Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It&#39;s so simple you can eat
it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.
What a cozy room this is!&quot;

&quot;It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don&#39;t
know how to make them mind.  It worries me though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth
brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and
the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from
the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you&#39;re fixed.&quot;

And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things
into place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched
her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he
sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...

&quot;How kind you are!  Yes, that&#39;s what it wanted.  Now please take the
big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.&quot;

&quot;No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?&quot; and Jo looked
affectionately toward some inviting books near by.

&quot;Thank you!  I&#39;ve read all those, and if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d rather
talk,&quot; answered Laurie.

&quot;Not a bit.  I&#39;ll talk all day if you&#39;ll only set me going. Beth says I
never know when to stop.&quot;

&quot;Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes
out with a little basket?&quot; asked Laurie with interest.

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s Beth.  She&#39;s my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.&quot;

&quot;The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?&quot;

&quot;How did you find that out?&quot;

Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, &quot;Why, you see I often hear you
calling to one another, and when I&#39;m alone up here, I can&#39;t help
looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good
times.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget
to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when
the lamps are lighted, it&#39;s like looking at a picture to see the fire,
and you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right
opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can&#39;t help
watching it.  I haven&#39;t got any mother, you know.&quot; And Laurie poked the
fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.

The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo&#39;s warm heart.
She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,
and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was
sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,
she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and
her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...

&quot;We&#39;ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look
as much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you&#39;d
come over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she&#39;d do you heaps of
good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would
dance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,
and we&#39;d have jolly times.  Wouldn&#39;t your grandpa let you?&quot;

&quot;I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He&#39;s very kind, though he
does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he&#39;s
afraid I might be a bother to strangers,&quot; began Laurie, brightening
more and more.

&quot;We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn&#39;t think you&#39;d be
a bother.  We want to know you, and I&#39;ve been trying to do it this ever
so long.  We haven&#39;t been here a great while, you know, but we have got
acquainted with all our neighbors but you.&quot;

&quot;You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn&#39;t mind much what
happens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn&#39;t stay here, you know,
and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get
on as I can.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere
you are asked, then you&#39;ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places
to go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won&#39;t last long if you keep
going.&quot;

Laurie turned red again, but wasn&#39;t offended at being accused of
bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible
not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.

&quot;Do you like your school?&quot; asked the boy, changing the subject, after a
little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about
her, well pleased.

&quot;Don&#39;t go to school, I&#39;m a businessman--girl, I mean.  I go to wait on
my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,&quot; answered Jo.

Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just
in time that it wasn&#39;t manners to make too many inquiries into people&#39;s
affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.

Jo liked his good breeding, and didn&#39;t mind having a laugh at Aunt
March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,
her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where
she reveled.

Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old
gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine
speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy
lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid
popped her head in to see what was the matter.

&quot;Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,&quot; he said, taking
his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.

Much elated with her success, Jo did &#39;tell on&#39;, all about their plays
and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting
events of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got
to talking about books, and to Jo&#39;s delight, she found that Laurie
loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.

&quot;If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,
so you needn&#39;t be afraid,&quot; said Laurie, getting up.

&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of anything,&quot; returned Jo, with a toss of the head.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you are!&quot; exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much
admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to
be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his
moods.

The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way
from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her
fancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her
hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was
lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting
little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow
chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open
fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.

&quot;What richness!&quot; sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair
and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. &quot;Theodore
Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,&quot; she added
impressively.

&quot;A fellow can&#39;t live on books,&quot; said Laurie, shaking his head as he
perched on a table opposite.

Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with
alarm, &quot;Mercy me!  It&#39;s your grandpa!&quot;

&quot;Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,&quot;
returned the boy, looking wicked.

&quot;I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don&#39;t know why I should
be.  Marmee said I might come, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re any the worse
for it,&quot; said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the
door.

&quot;I&#39;m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I&#39;m only
afraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I
couldn&#39;t bear to stop,&quot; said Laurie gratefully.

&quot;The doctor to see you, sir,&quot; and the maid beckoned as she spoke.

&quot;Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,&quot;
said Laurie.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind me.  I&#39;m happy as a cricket here,&quot; answered Jo.

Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was
standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door
opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, &quot;I&#39;m sure now
that I shouldn&#39;t be afraid of him, for he&#39;s got kind eyes, though his
mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.
He isn&#39;t as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her
great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.

Poor Jo blushed till she couldn&#39;t blush any redder, and her heart began
to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a
minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,
and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out
of the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living
eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,
and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good
deal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said
abruptly, after the dreadful pause, &quot;So you&#39;re not afraid of me, hey?&quot;

&quot;Not much, sir.&quot;

&quot;And you don&#39;t think me as handsome as your grandfather?&quot;

&quot;Not quite, sir.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve got a tremendous will, have I?&quot;

&quot;I only said I thought so.&quot;

&quot;But you like me in spite of it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do, sir.&quot;

That answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook
hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her
face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, &quot;You&#39;ve
got your grandfather&#39;s spirit, if you haven&#39;t his face.  He was a fine
man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and
I was proud to be his friend.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it
suited her exactly.

&quot;What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?&quot; was the next
question, sharply put.

&quot;Only trying to be neighborly, sir.&quot;  And Jo told how her visit came
about.

&quot;You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good
perhaps.  We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,
for we don&#39;t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,&quot; said
Jo eagerly.

&quot;Tut, tut, tut!  That was the boy&#39;s affair.  How is the poor woman?&quot;

&quot;Doing nicely, sir.&quot;  And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told
all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends
than they were.

&quot;Just her father&#39;s way of doing good.  I shall come and see your mother
some fine day.  Tell her so.  There&#39;s the tea bell, we have it early on
the boy&#39;s account.  Come down and go on being neighborly.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;d like to have me, sir.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t ask you, if I didn&#39;t.&quot;  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm
with old-fashioned courtesy.

&quot;What would Meg say to this?&quot; thought Jo, as she was marched away,
while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the
story at home.

&quot;Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?&quot; said the old
gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a
start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his
redoubtable grandfather.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d come, sir,&quot; he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant
little glance.

&quot;That&#39;s evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,
sir, and behave like a gentleman.&quot;  And having pulled the boy&#39;s hair by
way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a
series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an
explosion of laughter from Jo.

The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,
but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old
friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was
color, light, and life in the boy&#39;s face now, vivacity in his manner,
and genuine merriment in his laugh.

&quot;She&#39;s right, the lad is lonely.  I&#39;ll see what these little girls can
do for him,&quot; thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked
Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand
the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.

If the Laurences had been what Jo called &#39;prim and poky&#39;, she would not
have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.
But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good
impression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had
something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,
which had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to
Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on
either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful
vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the
finest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,
with the happy look Jo liked to see, &quot;Please give these to your mother,
and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.&quot;

They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing
room, but Jo&#39;s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which
stood open.

&quot;Do you play?&quot; she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful
expression.

&quot;Sometimes,&quot; he answered modestly.

&quot;Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.&quot;

&quot;Won&#39;t you first?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.&quot;

So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in
heliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the &#39;Laurence&#39;
boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn&#39;t put
on any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,
only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to
his rescue.

&quot;That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not
good for him.  His music isn&#39;t bad, but I hope he will do as well in
more important things.  Going?  well, I&#39;m much obliged to you, and I
hope you&#39;ll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor
Jo.&quot;

He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.
When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something
amiss.  He shook his head.

&quot;No, it was me.  He doesn&#39;t like to hear me play.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it&#39;s only a step.  Take
care of yourself, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but you will come again, I hope?&quot;

&quot;If you promise to come and see us after you are well.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;

&quot;Good night, Laurie!&quot;

&quot;Good night, Jo, good night!&quot;

When all the afternoon&#39;s adventures had been told, the family felt
inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very
attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March
wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten
him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand
piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.

&quot;Mother, why didn&#39;t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?&quot; asked Jo,
who was of an inquiring disposition.

&quot;I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie&#39;s father,
married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who
is very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he
did not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both
died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him
home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and
the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.
Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,
and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.
At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so
he &#39;glowered&#39; as Jo said.&quot;

&quot;Dear me, how romantic!&quot; exclaimed Meg.

&quot;How silly!&quot; said Jo.  &quot;Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not
plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I
suppose.  Italians are always nice,&quot; said Meg, who was a little
sentimental.

&quot;What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to
him, hardly,&quot; cried Jo, who was not sentimental.

&quot;I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to
behave.  That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent
him.&quot;

&quot;He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;How stupid you are, child!  He meant you, of course.&quot;

&quot;Did he?&quot; And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her
before.

&quot;I never saw such a girl!  You don&#39;t know a compliment when you get
it,&quot; said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the
matter.

&quot;I think they are great nonsense, and I&#39;ll thank you not to be silly
and spoil my fun.  Laurie&#39;s a nice boy and I like him, and I won&#39;t have
any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.  We&#39;ll all be
good to him because he hasn&#39;t got any mother, and he may come over and
see us, mayn&#39;t he, Marmee?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will
remember that children should be children as long as they can.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t call myself a child, and I&#39;m not in my teens yet,&quot; observed
Amy.  &quot;What do you say, Beth?&quot;

&quot;I was thinking about our &#39;_Pilgrim&#39;s Progress_&#39;,&quot; answered Beth, who
had not heard a word.  &quot;How we got out of the Slough and through the
Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,
and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going
to be our Palace Beautiful.&quot;

&quot;We have got to get by the lions first,&quot; said Jo, as if she rather
liked the prospect.



CHAPTER SIX

BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL

The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time
for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old
Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said
something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old
times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid
Beth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,
for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.
But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,
and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March&#39;s
motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in
that humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and
interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.

All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new
friendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,
and he privately informed his tutor that &quot;the Marches were regularly
splendid girls.&quot;  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took
the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found
something very charming in the innocent companionship of these
simple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was
quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,
lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired
of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was
obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always
playing truant and running over to the Marches&#39;.

&quot;Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,&quot; said
the old gentleman.  &quot;The good lady next door says he is studying too
hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she
is right, and that I&#39;ve been coddling the fellow as if I&#39;d been his
grandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He
can&#39;t get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.
March is doing more for him than we can.&quot;

What good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such
sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old
parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.
Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in
bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed
the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed
beauty to her heart&#39;s content, and Laurie played &#39;lord of the manor&#39; in
the most delightful style.

But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up
courage to go to the &#39;Mansion of Bliss&#39;, as Meg called it.  She went
once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,
stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said &quot;Hey!&quot; so
loud, that he frightened her so much her &#39;feet chattered on the floor&#39;,
she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never
go there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or
enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.
Laurence&#39;s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.
During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation
to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine
organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found
it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and
nearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and
stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with
excitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her
than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie&#39;s
lessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred
to him, he said to Mrs. March...

&quot;The boy neglects his music now, and I&#39;m glad of it, for he was getting
too fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn&#39;t some
of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just
to keep it in tune, you know, ma&#39;am?&quot;

Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to
keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and
the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her
breath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with
an odd little nod and smile...

&quot;They needn&#39;t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I&#39;m
shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a
great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine
o&#39;clock.&quot;

Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that
last arrangement left nothing to be desired.  &quot;Please, tell the young
ladies what I say, and if they don&#39;t care to come, why, never mind.&quot;
Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a
face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...

&quot;Oh sir, they do care, very very much!&quot;

&quot;Are you the musical girl?&quot; he asked, without any startling &quot;Hey!&quot; as
he looked down at her very kindly.

&quot;I&#39;m Beth.  I love it dearly, and I&#39;ll come, if you are quite sure
nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,&quot; she added, fearing to be rude,
and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.

&quot;Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and
drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.&quot;

&quot;How kind you are, sir!&quot;

Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was
not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she
had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The
old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping
down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...

&quot;I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my
dear!  Good day, madam.&quot;  And away he went, in a great hurry.

Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the
glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.
How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her
because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in
her sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out
of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the
side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing
room where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,
easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent
stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great
instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything
else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was
like the voice of a beloved friend.

She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no
appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state
of beatitude.

After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly
every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit
that came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his
study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw
Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never
suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the
rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her
about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things
that helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,
what isn&#39;t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had
hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing
that a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.

&quot;Mother, I&#39;m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so
kind to me, I must thank him, and I don&#39;t know any other way. Can I do
it?&quot; asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.

&quot;Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of
thanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for
the making up,&quot; replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in
granting Beth&#39;s requests because she so seldom asked anything for
herself.

After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,
the materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet
cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very
appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with
occasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,
and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote
a short, simple note, and with Laurie&#39;s help, got them smuggled onto
the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.

When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.
All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement
arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety
friend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an
errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As
she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads
popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,
several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...

&quot;Here&#39;s a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Beth, he&#39;s sent you...&quot; began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly
energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down
the window.

Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters
seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all
pointing and all saying at once, &quot;Look there!  Look there!&quot;  Beth did
look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a
little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed
like a sign board to &quot;Miss Elizabeth March.&quot;

&quot;For me?&quot; gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should
tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.

&quot;Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn&#39;t it splendid of him?  Don&#39;t you
think he&#39;s the dearest old man in the world?  Here&#39;s the key in the
letter.  We didn&#39;t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,&quot;
cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.

&quot;You read it!  I can&#39;t, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!&quot; and
Beth hid her face in Jo&#39;s apron, quite upset by her present.

Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw
were...

&quot;Miss March: &quot;Dear Madam--&quot;

&quot;How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!&quot; said Amy,
who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.

&quot;&#39;I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours,&#39;&quot; continues Jo.  &quot;&#39;Heart&#39;s-ease is my
favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.
I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow &#39;the old gentleman&#39; to
send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he
lost.  With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain &quot;&#39;Your grateful
friend and humble servant, &#39;JAMES LAURENCE&#39;.&quot;

&quot;There, Beth, that&#39;s an honor to be proud of, I&#39;m sure! Laurie told me
how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept
all her little things carefully.  Just think, he&#39;s given you her piano.
That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,&quot; said Jo, trying
to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever
been before.

&quot;See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,
puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and
stool, all complete,&quot; added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying
its beauties.

&quot;&#39;Your humble servant, James Laurence&#39;.  Only think of his writing that
to you.  I&#39;ll tell the girls.  They&#39;ll think it&#39;s splendid,&quot; said Amy,
much impressed by the note.

&quot;Try it, honey.  Let&#39;s hear the sound of the baby pianny,&quot; said Hannah,
who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.

So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano
ever heard.  It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie
order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the
happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly
touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright
pedals.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to go and thank him,&quot; said Jo, by way of a joke, for the
idea of the child&#39;s really going never entered her head.

&quot;Yes, I mean to.  I guess I&#39;ll go now, before I get frightened thinking
about it.&quot; And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth
walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the
Laurences&#39; door.

&quot;Well, I wish I may die if it ain&#39;t the queerest thing I ever see!  The
pianny has turned her head!  She&#39;d never have gone in her right mind,&quot;
cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite
speechless by the miracle.

They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did
afterward.  If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study
door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice
called out, &quot;come in!&quot; she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who
looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a
small quaver in her voice, &quot;I came to thank you, sir, for...&quot; But she
didn&#39;t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech
and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she
put both arms round his neck and kissed him.

If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman
wouldn&#39;t have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he
liked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding
little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on
his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as
if he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to
fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if
she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude
can conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own
gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back
again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old
gentleman, as he was.

When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of
expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her
surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, &quot;Well, I do believe
the world is coming to an end.&quot;



CHAPTER SEVEN

AMY&#39;S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION

&quot;That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn&#39;t he?&quot; said Amy one day, as Laurie
clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.

&quot;How dare you say so, when he&#39;s got both his eyes?  And very handsome
ones they are, too,&quot; cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about
her friend.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say anything about his eyes, and I don&#39;t see why you need
fire up when I admire his riding.&quot;

&quot;Oh, my goodness!  That little goose means a centaur, and she called
him a Cyclops,&quot; exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.

&quot;You needn&#39;t be so rude, it&#39;s only a &#39;lapse of lingy&#39;, as Mr. Davis
says,&quot; retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.  &quot;I just wish I had a
little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,&quot; she added, as if to
herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.

&quot;Why?&quot; asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy&#39;s
second blunder.

&quot;I need it so much.  I&#39;m dreadfully in debt, and it won&#39;t be my turn to
have the rag money for a month.&quot;

&quot;In debt, Amy?  What do you mean?&quot; And Meg looked sober.

&quot;Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can&#39;t pay them, you
know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged
at the shop.&quot;

&quot;Tell me all about it.  Are limes the fashion now?  It used to be
pricking bits of rubber to make balls.&quot;  And Meg tried to keep her
countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.

&quot;Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to
be thought mean, you must do it too.  It&#39;s nothing but limes now, for
everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them
off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess.
If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.  If she&#39;s mad with
her, she eats one before her face, and doesn&#39;t offer even a suck.  They
treat by turns, and I&#39;ve had ever so many but haven&#39;t returned them,
and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.&quot;

&quot;How much will pay them off and restore your credit?&quot; asked Meg, taking
out her purse.

&quot;A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a
treat for you.  Don&#39;t you like limes?&quot;

&quot;Not much.  You may have my share.  Here&#39;s the money.  Make it last as
long as you can, for it isn&#39;t very plenty, you know.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you!  It must be so nice to have pocket money!  I&#39;ll have a
grand feast, for I haven&#39;t tasted a lime this week.  I felt delicate
about taking any, as I couldn&#39;t return them, and I&#39;m actually suffering
for one.&quot;

Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the
temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper
parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.
During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got
twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to
treat circulated through her &#39;set&#39;, and the attentions of her friends
became quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on
the spot.  Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess,
and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon
her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish
answers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss
Snow&#39;s cutting remarks about &#39;some persons whose noses were not too
flat to smell other people&#39;s limes, and stuck-up people who were not
too proud to ask for them&#39;, and she instantly crushed &#39;that Snow
girl&#39;s&#39; hopes by the withering telegram, &quot;You needn&#39;t be so polite all
of a sudden, for you won&#39;t get any.&quot;

A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,
and Amy&#39;s beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her
foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume
the airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes
before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with
disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale
compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking
an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March
had pickled limes in her desk.

Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly
vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the
law.  This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum
after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated
novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had
forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done
all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in
order.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but
girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with
tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of
all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,
feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular
importance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and
Jenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong
that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his
neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he
deserved.  Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language
of a schoolgirl, &quot;He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear&quot;.
The word &#39;limes&#39; was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and
he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat
with unusual rapidity.

&quot;Young ladies, attention, if you please!&quot;

At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,
gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.

&quot;Miss March, come to the desk.&quot;

Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed
her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.

&quot;Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,&quot; was the unexpected
command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.

&quot;Don&#39;t take all.&quot; whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great
presence of mind.

Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr.
Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when
that delicious perfume met his nose.  Unfortunately, Mr. Davis
particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust
added to his wrath.

&quot;Is that all?&quot;

&quot;Not quite,&quot; stammered Amy.

&quot;Bring the rest immediately.&quot;

With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.

&quot;You are sure there are no more?&quot;

&quot;I never lie, sir.&quot;

&quot;So I see.  Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them
out of the window.&quot;

There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as
the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.
Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,
and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from
her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of
the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by
the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.  This--this was
too much.  All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable
Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.

As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous &quot;Hem!&quot;
and said, in his most impressive manner...

&quot;Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.  I am sorry
this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I
never break my word.  Miss March, hold out your hand.&quot;

Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring
look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.
She was rather a favorite with &#39;old Davis&#39;, as, of course, he was
called, and it&#39;s my private belief that he would have broken his word
if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent
in a hiss.  That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible
gentleman, and sealed the culprit&#39;s fate.

&quot;Your hand, Miss March!&quot; was the only answer her mute appeal received,
and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head
defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her
little palm.  They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no
difference to her.  For the first time in her life she had been struck,
and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her
down.

&quot;You will now stand on the platform till recess,&quot; said Mr. Davis,
resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.

That was dreadful.  It would have been bad enough to go to her seat,
and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her
few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon
her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only
drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.  A bitter
sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,
and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove
funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so
motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that
pathetic figure before them.

During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive
little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.  To
others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a
hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been
governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her
before.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten
in the sting of the thought, &quot;I shall have to tell at home, and they
will be so disappointed in me!&quot;

The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,
and the word &#39;Recess!&#39; had never seemed so welcome to her before.

&quot;You can go, Miss March,&quot; said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,
uncomfortable.

He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she
went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched
her things, and left the place &quot;forever,&quot; as she passionately declared
to herself.  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the
older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held
at once.  Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and
comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg
bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even
her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo
wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and
Hannah shook her fist at the &#39;villain&#39; and pounded potatoes for dinner
as if she had him under her pestle.

No notice was taken of Amy&#39;s flight, except by her mates, but the
sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in
the afternoon, also unusually nervous.  Just before school closed, Jo
appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and
delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy&#39;s property, and
departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as
if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.

&quot;Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a
little every day with Beth,&quot; said Mrs. March that evening. &quot;I don&#39;t
approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.  I dislike Mr.
Davis&#39;s manner of teaching and don&#39;t think the girls you associate with
are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father&#39;s advice before I
send you anywhere else.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good!  I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old
school.  It&#39;s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,&quot;
sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.

&quot;I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved
some punishment for disobedience,&quot; was the severe reply, which rather
disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.

&quot;Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?&quot;
cried Amy.

&quot;I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,&quot; replied her
mother, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure that it won&#39;t do you more good than a bolder
method.  You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is
quite time you set about correcting it.  You have a good many little
gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit
spoils the finest genius.  There is not much danger that real talent or
goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of
possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of
all power is modesty.&quot;

&quot;So it is!&quot; cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.
&quot;I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and
she didn&#39;t know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed
when she was alone, and wouldn&#39;t have believed it if anyone had told
her.&quot;

&quot;I wish I&#39;d known that nice girl.  Maybe she would have helped me, I&#39;m
so stupid,&quot; said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.

&quot;You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,&quot;
answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his
merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face
in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.

Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who
could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So
Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly
lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his
character.  When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,
said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, &quot;Is Laurie an
accomplished boy?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will
make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,&quot; replied her mother.

&quot;And he isn&#39;t conceited, is he?&quot; asked Amy.

&quot;Not in the least.  That is why he is so charming and we all like him
so much.&quot;

&quot;I see.  It&#39;s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to
show off or get perked up,&quot; said Amy thoughtfully.

&quot;These things are always seen and felt in a person&#39;s manner and
conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display
them,&quot; said Mrs. March.

&quot;Any more than it&#39;s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and
ribbons at once, that folks may know you&#39;ve got them,&quot; added Jo, and
the lecture ended in a laugh.



CHAPTER EIGHT

JO MEETS APOLLYON

&quot;Girls, where are you going?&quot; asked Amy, coming into their room one
Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an
air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.

&quot;Never mind.  Little girls shouldn&#39;t ask questions,&quot; returned Jo
sharply.

Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,
it is to be told that, and to be bidden to &quot;run away, dear&quot; is still
more trying to us.  Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to
find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who
never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, &quot;Do tell me!
I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her
piano, and I haven&#39;t got anything to do, and am so lonely.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t, dear, because you aren&#39;t invited,&quot; began Meg, but Jo broke in
impatiently, &quot;Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.  You can&#39;t
go, Amy, so don&#39;t be a baby and whine about it.&quot;

&quot;You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.  You were
whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you
stopped when I came in.  Aren&#39;t you going with him?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we are.  Now do be still, and stop bothering.&quot;

Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her
pocket.

&quot;I know!  I know!  You&#39;re going to the theater to see the _Seven
Castles!_&quot; she cried, adding resolutely, &quot;and I shall go, for Mother
said I might see it, and I&#39;ve got my rag money, and it was mean not to
tell me in time.&quot;

&quot;Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,&quot; said Meg soothingly.
&quot;Mother doesn&#39;t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not
well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.  Next week you
can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please
let me.  I&#39;ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I&#39;m dying
for some fun.  Do, Meg!  I&#39;ll be ever so good,&quot; pleaded Amy, looking as
pathetic as she could.

&quot;Suppose we take her.  I don&#39;t believe Mother would mind, if we bundle
her up well,&quot; began Meg.

&quot;If she goes I shan&#39;t, and if I don&#39;t, Laurie won&#39;t like it, and it
will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy.  I
should think she&#39;d hate to poke herself where she isn&#39;t wanted,&quot; said
Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child
when she wanted to enjoy herself.

Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,
in her most aggravating way, &quot;I shall go.  Meg says I may, and if I pay
for myself, Laurie hasn&#39;t anything to do with it.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn&#39;t sit
alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our
pleasure.  Or he&#39;ll get another seat for you, and that isn&#39;t proper
when you weren&#39;t asked.  You shan&#39;t stir a step, so you may just stay
where you are,&quot; scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her
finger in her hurry.

Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to
reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls
hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she
forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the
party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening
tone, &quot;You&#39;ll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Fiddlesticks!&quot; returned Jo, slamming the door.

They had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_
was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the
comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and
princesses, Jo&#39;s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy
queen&#39;s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she
amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her
&#39;sorry for it&#39;.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the
course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be
violent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and
semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed
afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had
hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually
getting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having
humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do
better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a
fury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried
desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame
up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.

When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed
an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or
asked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered
resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing
description of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo&#39;s
first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had
soothed her feelings by turning Jo&#39;s top drawer upside down on the
floor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance
into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.

There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced
a tempest.  Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the
afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding
breathlessly, &quot;Has anyone taken my book?&quot;

Meg and Beth said, &quot;No.&quot; at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the
fire and said nothing.  Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in
a minute.

&quot;Amy, you&#39;ve got it!&quot;

&quot;No, I haven&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You know where it is, then!&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a fib!&quot; cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking
fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.

&quot;It isn&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t got it, don&#39;t know where it is now, and don&#39;t
care.&quot;

&quot;You know something about it, and you&#39;d better tell at once, or I&#39;ll
make you.&quot;  And Jo gave her a slight shake.

&quot;Scold as much as you like, you&#39;ll never see your silly old book
again,&quot; cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;I burned it up.&quot;

&quot;What!  My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to
finish before Father got home?  Have you really burned it?&quot; said Jo,
turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy
nervously.

&quot;Yes, I did!  I told you I&#39;d make you pay for being so cross yesterday,
and I have, so...&quot;

Amy got no farther, for Jo&#39;s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy
till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and
anger...

&quot;You wicked, wicked girl!  I never can write it again, and I&#39;ll never
forgive you as long as I live.&quot;

Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside
herself, and with a parting box on her sister&#39;s ear, she rushed out of
the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.

The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard
the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her
sister.  Jo&#39;s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her
family as a literary sprout of great promise.  It was only half a dozen
little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her
whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to
print.  She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the
old manuscript, so that Amy&#39;s bonfire had consumed the loving work of
several years.  It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a
dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.
Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her
pet.  Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one
would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now
regretted more than any of them.

When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable
that it took all Amy&#39;s courage to say meekly...

&quot;Please forgive me, Jo.  I&#39;m very, very sorry.&quot;

&quot;I never shall forgive you,&quot; was Jo&#39;s stern answer, and from that
moment she ignored Amy entirely.

No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had
learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,
and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own
generous nature, softened Jo&#39;s resentment and healed the breach.  It
was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their
mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was
wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed.  They felt this most
when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a
stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.  But in spite
of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not
seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.

As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, &quot;My
dear, don&#39;t let the sun go down upon your anger.  Forgive each other,
help each other, and begin again tomorrow.&quot;

Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her
grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she
felt so deeply injured that she really couldn&#39;t quite forgive yet.  So
she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was
listening, &quot;It was an abominable thing, and she doesn&#39;t deserve to be
forgiven.&quot;

With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or
confidential gossip that night.

Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed,
and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured
than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which
was particularly exasperating.  Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,
and nothing went well all day.  It was bitter cold in the morning, she
dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack
of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful
when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were
always talking about being good and yet wouldn&#39;t even try when other
people set them a virtuous example.

&quot;Everybody is so hateful, I&#39;ll ask Laurie to go skating.  He is always
kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,&quot; said Jo to herself,
and off she went.

Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient
exclamation.

&quot;There!  She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice
we shall have.  But it&#39;s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that.  You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the
loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and
I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,&quot; said Meg.  &quot;Go
after them.  Don&#39;t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with
Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind
thing, and I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be friends again with all her heart.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to
get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over
the hill.

It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached
them.  Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.  Laurie did not see, for
he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm
spell had preceded the cold snap.

&quot;I&#39;ll go on to the first bend, and see if it&#39;s all right before we
begin to race,&quot; Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a
young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.

Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on
her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and
went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of
satisfaction in her sister&#39;s troubles. She had cherished her anger till
it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and
feelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,
he shouted back...

&quot;Keep near the shore.  It isn&#39;t safe in the middle.&quot; Jo heard, but Amy
was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word.  Jo glanced over
her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...

&quot;No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.&quot;

Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,
far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the
river.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her
heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her
round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a
sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made
Jo&#39;s heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her
voice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have
no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,
staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the
black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie&#39;s voice cried
out...

&quot;Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!&quot;

How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked
as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,
and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged
a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more
frightened than hurt.

&quot;Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on
her, while I get off these confounded skates,&quot; cried Laurie, wrapping
his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed
so intricate before.

Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an
exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot
fire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,
looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and
her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When
Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by
the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.

&quot;Are you sure she is safe?&quot; whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the
golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever
under the treacherous ice.

&quot;Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won&#39;t even take cold, I think,
you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,&quot; replied
her mother cheerfully.

&quot;Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it
would be my fault.&quot;  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of
penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her
hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the
heavy punishment which might have come upon her.

&quot;It&#39;s my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then
it breaks out worse than ever.  Oh, Mother, what shall I do?  What
shall I do?&quot; cried poor Jo, in despair.

&quot;Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is
impossible to conquer your fault,&quot; said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy
head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo
cried even harder.

&quot;You don&#39;t know, you can&#39;t guess how bad it is!  It seems as if I could
do anything when I&#39;m in a passion.  I get so savage, I could hurt
anyone and enjoy it.  I&#39;m afraid I shall do something dreadful some
day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help
me, do help me!&quot;

&quot;I will, my child, I will.  Don&#39;t cry so bitterly, but remember this
day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another
like it.  Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than
yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.  You think
your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like
it.&quot;

&quot;Yours, Mother?  Why, you are never angry!&quot;  And for the moment Jo
forgot remorse in surprise.

&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded
in controlling it.  I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I
have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,
though it may take me another forty years to do so.&quot;

The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a
better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.  She
felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her.  The
knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,
made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it,
though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a
girl of fifteen.

&quot;Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go
out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?&quot;
asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and
when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away
for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and
wicked,&quot; answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed
and fastened up Jo&#39;s disheveled hair.

&quot;How did you learn to keep still?  That is what troubles me, for the
sharp words fly out before I know what I&#39;m about, and the more I say
the worse I get, till it&#39;s a pleasure to hurt people&#39;s feelings and say
dreadful things.  Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.&quot;

&quot;My good mother used to help me...&quot;

&quot;As you do us...&quot; interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.

&quot;But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years
had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to
anyone else.  I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears
over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.
Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be
good.  But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we
were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by
nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.&quot;

&quot;Poor Mother!  What helped you then?&quot;

&quot;Your father, Jo.  He never loses patience, never doubts or complains,
but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed
to do otherwise before him.  He helped and comforted me, and showed me
that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little
girls possess, for I was their example.  It was easier to try for your
sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you
when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,
and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest
reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them
copy.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Mother, if I&#39;m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,&quot;
cried Jo, much touched.

&quot;I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch
over your &#39;bosom enemy&#39;, as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not
spoil your life.  You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with
heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you
greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.&quot;

&quot;I will try, Mother, I truly will.  But you must help me, remind me,
and keep me from flying out.  I used to see Father sometimes put his
finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,
and you always folded your lips tight and went away.  Was he reminding
you then?&quot; asked Jo softly.

&quot;Yes.  I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me
from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.&quot;

Jo saw that her mother&#39;s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she
spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,
&quot;Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it?  I didn&#39;t mean to be
rude, but it&#39;s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so
safe and happy here.&quot;

&quot;My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest
happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how
much I love them.&quot;

&quot;I thought I&#39;d grieved you.&quot;

&quot;No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how
much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his
little daughters safe and good for him.&quot;

&quot;Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn&#39;t cry when he went, and never
complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,&quot; said Jo, wondering.

&quot;I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was
gone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty
and will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don&#39;t seem to
need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to
comfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your
life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive
them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your
Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love
and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will
depend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or
change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of
lifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go
to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as
freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.&quot;

Jo&#39;s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which
followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart
without words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not
only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of
self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother&#39;s hand, she had
drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love
stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.

Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once
to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it
had never worn before.

&quot;I let the sun go down on my anger.  I wouldn&#39;t forgive her, and today,
if it hadn&#39;t been for Laurie, it might have been too late!  How could I
be so wicked?&quot; said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister
softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.

As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a
smile that went straight to Jo&#39;s heart.  Neither said a word, but they
hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was
forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.



CHAPTER NINE

MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR

&quot;I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those
children should have the measles just now,&quot; said Meg, one April day, as
she stood packing the &#39;go abroady&#39; trunk in her room, surrounded by her
sisters.

&quot;And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.  A whole
fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,&quot; replied Jo, looking like
a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.

&quot;And such lovely weather, I&#39;m so glad of that,&quot; added Beth, tidily
sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great
occasion.

&quot;I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice
things,&quot; said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically
replenished her sister&#39;s cushion.

&quot;I wish you were all going, but as you can&#39;t, I shall keep my
adventures to tell you when I come back.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the least I can
do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get
ready,&quot; said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,
which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.

&quot;What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?&quot; asked Amy, who had
not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.
March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when
the proper time came.

&quot;A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue
sash.  I wanted the violet silk, but there isn&#39;t time to make it over,
so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.&quot;


&quot;It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it
off beautifully.  I wish I hadn&#39;t smashed my coral bracelet, for you
might have had it,&quot; said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose
possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.

&quot;There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but
Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,
and Laurie promised to send me all I want,&quot; replied Meg.  &quot;Now, let me
see, there&#39;s my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my
hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks
heavy for spring, doesn&#39;t it?  The violet silk would be so nice.  Oh,
dear!&quot;

&quot;Never mind, you&#39;ve got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always
look like an angel in white,&quot; said Amy, brooding over the little store
of finery in which her soul delighted.

&quot;It isn&#39;t low-necked, and it doesn&#39;t sweep enough, but it will have to
do.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that
I feel as if I&#39;d got a new one.  My silk sacque isn&#39;t a bit the
fashion, and my bonnet doesn&#39;t look like Sallie&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t like to
say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told
Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one
with a yellowish handle.  It&#39;s strong and neat, so I ought not to
complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie&#39;s silk one
with a gold top,&quot; sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great
disfavor.

&quot;Change it,&quot; advised Jo.

&quot;I won&#39;t be so silly, or hurt Marmee&#39;s feelings, when she took so much
pains to get my things.  It&#39;s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I&#39;m not
going to give up to it.  My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves
are my comfort.  You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.  I feel so rich
and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up
for common.&quot;  And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.

&quot;Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put
some on mine?&quot; she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,
fresh from Hannah&#39;s hands.

&quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t, for the smart caps won&#39;t match the plain gowns without
any trimming on them.  Poor folks shouldn&#39;t rig,&quot; said Jo decidedly.

&quot;I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my
clothes and bows on my caps?&quot; said Meg impatiently.

&quot;You said the other day that you&#39;d be perfectly happy if you could only
go to Annie Moffat&#39;s,&quot; observed Beth in her quiet way.

&quot;So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won&#39;t fret, but it does seem as if
the more one gets the more one wants, doesn&#39;t it?  There now, the trays
are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for
Mother to pack,&quot; said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the
half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,
which she called her &#39;ball dress&#39; with an important air.

The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of
novelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather
reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented
than she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take
good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a
winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went
to take her first taste of fashionable life.

The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,
at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its
occupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life
they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,
without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated
or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite
conceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly
was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her
best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her
exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of
those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,
crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as
well as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat&#39;s pretty things,
the more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare
and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she
felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of
the new gloves and silk stockings.

She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls
were busily employed in &#39;having a good time&#39;.  They shopped, walked,
rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at
home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to
entertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one
was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.
Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and
Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as
her daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and &#39;Daisey&#39;, as they
called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.

When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin
wouldn&#39;t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses
and making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,
looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie&#39;s crisp new
one.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her
cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.
No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and
Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white
arms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her
heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others
laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,
bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box
of flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all
were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.

&quot;It&#39;s for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are
altogether ravishing,&quot; cried Annie, with a great sniff.

&quot;They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here&#39;s a note,&quot; put in the
maid, holding it to Meg.

&quot;What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn&#39;t know you had a lover,&quot; cried the
girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.

&quot;The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,&quot; said Meg
simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.

&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note
into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false
pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers
cheered her up by their beauty.

Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for
herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the
breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that
Clara, the elder sister, told her she was &#39;the sweetest little thing
she ever saw&#39;, and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.
Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest
went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed
face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and
fastened the roses in the dress that didn&#39;t strike her as so very
shabby now.

She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her
heart&#39;s content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three
compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a
remarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who &#39;the fresh little girl
with the beautiful eyes&#39; was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with
her because she &#39;didn&#39;t dawdle, but had some spring in her&#39;, as he
gracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till
she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.
She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner
to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of
the flowery wall...

&quot;How old is he?&quot;

&quot;Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,&quot; replied another voice.

&quot;It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn&#39;t it?  Sallie
says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.&quot;

&quot;Mrs. M.  has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,
early as it is.  The girl evidently doesn&#39;t think of it yet,&quot; said Mrs.
Moffat.

&quot;She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up
when the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She&#39;d be so nice if
she was only got up in style.  Do you think she&#39;d be offended if we
offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?&quot; asked another voice.

&quot;She&#39;s proud, but I don&#39;t believe she&#39;d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton
is all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good
excuse for offering a decent one.&quot;

Here Meg&#39;s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and
rather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,
for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what
she had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she
could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to
forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, &quot;Mrs. M.  has
made her plans,&quot; &quot;that fib about her mamma,&quot; and &quot;dowdy tarlaton,&quot; till
she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for
advice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and
being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an
effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she
was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till
her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.
Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and
much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived
as happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled
by the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a
little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,
who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be
contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man&#39;s daughter
was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby
dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.

Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half
resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not
speaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled
that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even
to take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends
struck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,
took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with
eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered
her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from
her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...

&quot;Daisy, dear, I&#39;ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for
Thursday.  We should like to know him, and it&#39;s only a proper
compliment to you.&quot;

Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply
demurely, &quot;You are very kind, but I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t come.&quot;

&quot;Why not, Cherie?&quot; asked Miss Belle.

&quot;He&#39;s too old.&quot;

&quot;My child, what do you mean?  What is his age, I beg to know!&quot; cried
Miss Clara.

&quot;Nearly seventy, I believe,&quot; answered Meg, counting stitches to hide
the merriment in her eyes.

&quot;You sly creature!  Of course we meant the young man,&quot; exclaimed Miss
Belle, laughing.

&quot;There isn&#39;t any, Laurie is only a little boy.&quot;  And Meg laughed also
at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her
supposed lover.

&quot;About your age,&quot; Nan said.

&quot;Nearer my sister Jo&#39;s; I am seventeen in August,&quot; returned Meg,
tossing her head.

&quot;It&#39;s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Annie,
looking wise about nothing.

&quot;Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are
so fond of them.  My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,
so it is quite natural that we children should play together,&quot; and Meg
hoped they would say no more.

&quot;It&#39;s evident Daisy isn&#39;t out yet,&quot; said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.

&quot;Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,&quot; returned Miss Belle
with a shrug.

&quot;I&#39;m going out to get some little matters for my girls.  Can I do
anything for you, young ladies?&quot; asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like
an elephant in silk and lace.

&quot;No, thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; replied Sallie.  &quot;I&#39;ve got my new pink silk for
Thursday and don&#39;t want a thing.&quot;

&quot;Nor I...&quot; began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she
did want several things and could not have them.

&quot;What shall you wear?&quot; asked Sallie.

&quot;My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly
torn last night,&quot; said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling
very uncomfortable.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you send home for another?&quot; said Sallie, who was not an
observing young lady.

&quot;I haven&#39;t got any other.&quot;  It cost Meg an effort to say that, but
Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, &quot;Only that?
How funny...&quot;  She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head
at her and broke in, saying kindly...

&quot;Not at all.  Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she
isn&#39;t out yet?  There&#39;s no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had
a dozen, for I&#39;ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I&#39;ve outgrown,
and you shall wear it to please me, won&#39;t you, dear?&quot;

&quot;You are very kind, but I don&#39;t mind my old dress if you don&#39;t, it does
well enough for a little girl like me,&quot; said Meg.

&quot;Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to
do it, and you&#39;d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and
there.  I shan&#39;t let anyone see you till you are done, and then we&#39;ll
burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,&quot;
said Belle in her persuasive tone.

Meg couldn&#39;t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if
she would be &#39;a little beauty&#39; after touching up caused her to accept
and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.

On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and
between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled
her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,
touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense
would have added &#39;a soupcon of rouge&#39;, if Meg had not rebelled.  They
laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly
breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in
the mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,
brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink
silk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and
a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,
and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her
heart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder
holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the
satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.

&quot;Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?&quot; cried Hortense,
clasping her hands in an affected rapture.

&quot;Come and show yourself,&quot; said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room
where the others were waiting.

As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings
tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her
fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that
she was &#39;a little beauty&#39;.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase
enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in
the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like
a party of magpies.

&quot;While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt
and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver
butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,
Clara, and don&#39;t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,&quot;
said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.

&quot;You don&#39;t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I&#39;m nowhere
beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you&#39;re quite French, I
assure you.  Let your flowers hang, don&#39;t be so careful of them, and be
sure you don&#39;t trip,&quot; returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was
prettier than herself.

Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs
and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early
guests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm
about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures
their respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her
before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young
gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only
stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but
agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,
and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air
of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...

&quot;Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,
but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;
sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.&quot;

&quot;Dear me!&quot; said the old lady, putting up her glass for another
observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been
rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat&#39;s fibs. The &#39;queer feeling&#39; did not pass
away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so
got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the
train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest
her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.  She was flirting
her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried
to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,
for just opposite, she saw Laurie.  He was staring at her with
undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he
bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and
wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle
nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to
see, looked unusually boyish and shy.

&quot;Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.  I won&#39;t care for
it, or let it change me a bit,&quot; thought Meg, and rustled across the
room to shake hands with her friend.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn&#39;t.&quot; she said, with her most
grown-up air.

&quot;Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,&quot; answered
Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her
maternal tone.

&quot;What shall you tell her?&quot; asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his
opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.

&quot;I shall say I didn&#39;t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike
yourself, I&#39;m quite afraid of you,&quot; he said, fumbling at his glove
button.

&quot;How absurd of you!  The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like
it.  Wouldn&#39;t Jo stare if she saw me?&quot; said Meg, bent on making him say
whether he thought her improved or not.

&quot;Yes, I think she would,&quot; returned Laurie gravely.

&quot;Don&#39;t you like me so?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; was the blunt reply.

&quot;Why not?&quot; in an anxious tone.

He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically
trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,
which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.

&quot;I don&#39;t like fuss and feathers.&quot;

That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg
walked away, saying petulantly, &quot;You are the rudest boy I ever saw.&quot;

Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool
her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant
color.  As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after
she heard him saying to his mother...

&quot;They are making a fool of that little girl.  I wanted you to see her,
but they have spoiled her entirely.  She&#39;s nothing but a doll tonight.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Meg.  &quot;I wish I&#39;d been sensible and worn my own
things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so
uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.&quot;

She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the
curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some
one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he
said, with his very best bow and his hand out...

&quot;Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,&quot; said Meg, trying to
look offended and failing entirely.

&quot;Not a bit of it, I&#39;m dying to do it.  Come, I&#39;ll be good. I don&#39;t like
your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.&quot; And he waved his
hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.

Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch
the time, &quot;Take care my skirt doesn&#39;t trip you up.  It&#39;s the plague of
my life and I was a goose to wear it.&quot;

&quot;Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,&quot; said Laurie,
looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.

Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,
they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant
sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more
friendly than ever after their small tiff.

&quot;Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?&quot; said Meg, as he stood
fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she
would not own why.

&quot;Won&#39;t I!&quot; said Laurie, with alacrity.

&quot;Please don&#39;t tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won&#39;t
understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you do it?&quot; said Laurie&#39;s eyes, so plainly that Meg
hastily added...

&quot;I shall tell them myself all about it, and &#39;fess&#39; to Mother how silly
I&#39;ve been.  But I&#39;d rather do it myself.  So you&#39;ll not tell, will you?&quot;

&quot;I give you my word I won&#39;t, only what shall I say when they ask me?&quot;

&quot;Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?  You
don&#39;t look as if you were having a good time.  Are you?&quot; And Laurie
looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...

&quot;No, not just now.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;m horrid.  I only wanted a little
fun, but this sort doesn&#39;t pay, I find, and I&#39;m getting tired of it.&quot;

&quot;Here comes Ned Moffat.  What does he want?&quot; said Laurie, knitting his
black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a
pleasant addition to the party.

&quot;He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he&#39;s coming for
them.  What a bore!&quot; said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused
Laurie immensely.

He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking
champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving &#39;like a
pair of fools&#39;, as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort
of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a
defender was needed.

&quot;You&#39;ll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.
I wouldn&#39;t, Meg, your mother doesn&#39;t like it, you know,&quot; he whispered,
leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher
stooped to pick up her fan.

&quot;I&#39;m not Meg tonight, I&#39;m &#39;a doll&#39; who does all sorts of crazy things.
Tomorrow I shall put away my &#39;fuss and feathers&#39; and be desperately
good again,&quot; she answered with an affected little laugh.

&quot;Wish tomorrow was here, then,&quot; muttered Laurie, walking off,
ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.

Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.
After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly
upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that
scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got
no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say
good night.

&quot;Remember!&quot; she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had
already begun.

&quot;Silence a la mort,&quot; replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as
he went away.

This little bit of byplay excited Annie&#39;s curiosity, but Meg was too
tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a
masquerade and hadn&#39;t enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was
sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with
her fortnight&#39;s fun and feeling that she had &#39;sat in the lap of luxury&#39;
long enough.

&quot;It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all
the time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn&#39;t splendid,&quot; said Meg,
looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother
and Jo on the Sunday evening.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem
dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,&quot; replied her mother, who
had given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick
to see any change in children&#39;s faces.

Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a
charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her
spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat
thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.
As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her
chair and, taking Beth&#39;s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother&#39;s knee,
saying bravely...

&quot;Marmee, I want to &#39;fess&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I thought so.  What is it, dear?&quot;

&quot;Shall I go away?&quot; asked Jo discreetly.

&quot;Of course not.  Don&#39;t I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to
speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the
dreadful things I did at the Moffats&#39;.&quot;

&quot;We are prepared,&quot; said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little
anxious.

&quot;I told you they dressed me up, but I didn&#39;t tell you that they
powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a
fashion-plate.  Laurie thought I wasn&#39;t proper.  I know he did, though
he didn&#39;t say so, and one man called me &#39;a doll&#39;.  I knew it was silly,
but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of
nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast
face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to
blame her little follies.

&quot;No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was
altogether abominable,&quot; said Meg self-reproachfully.

&quot;There is something more, I think.&quot;  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft
cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...

&quot;Yes.  It&#39;s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have
people say and think such things about us and Laurie.&quot;

Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats&#39;,
and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill
pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg&#39;s innocent mind.

&quot;Well, if that isn&#39;t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,&quot; cried Jo
indignantly.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you pop out and tell them so on the spot?&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn&#39;t help hearing at
first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn&#39;t remember that I
ought to go away.&quot;

&quot;Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I&#39;ll show you how to settle
such ridiculous stuff.  The idea of having &#39;plans&#39; and being kind to
Laurie because he&#39;s rich and may marry us by-and-by!  Won&#39;t he shout
when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?&quot;
And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good
joke.

&quot;If you tell Laurie, I&#39;ll never forgive you!  She mustn&#39;t, must she,
Mother?&quot; said Meg, looking distressed.

&quot;No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you
can,&quot; said Mrs. March gravely.  &quot;I was very unwise to let you go among
people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,
ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.  I am more
sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,
Meg.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry, I won&#39;t let it hurt me.  I&#39;ll forget all the bad and
remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you
very much for letting me go.  I&#39;ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,
Mother.  I know I&#39;m a silly little girl, and I&#39;ll stay with you till
I&#39;m fit to take care of myself.  But it is nice to be praised and
admired, and I can&#39;t help saying I like it,&quot; said Meg, looking half
ashamed of the confession.

&quot;That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not
become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.
Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite
the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,
Meg.&quot;

Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind
her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new
thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and
things of that sort.  And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her
sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a
world where she could not follow.

&quot;Mother, do you have &#39;plans&#39;, as Mrs. Moffat said?&quot; asked Meg bashfully.

&quot;Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ
somewhat from Mrs. Moffat&#39;s, I suspect.  I will tell you some of them,
for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and
heart of yours right, on a very serious subject.  You are young, Meg,
but not too young to understand me, and mothers&#39; lips are the fittest
to speak of such things to girls like you.  Jo, your turn will come in
time, perhaps, so listen to my &#39;plans&#39; and help me carry them out, if
they are good.&quot;

Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they
were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,
and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her
serious yet cheery way...

&quot;I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be
admired, loved, and respected.  To have a happy youth, to be well and
wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care
and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen
by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a
woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful
experience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait
for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes,
you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.  My dear
girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the
world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid
houses, which are not homes because love is wanting.  Money is a
needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I
never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.
I&#39;d rather see you poor men&#39;s wives, if you were happy, beloved,
contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.&quot;

&quot;Poor girls don&#39;t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put
themselves forward,&quot; sighed Meg.

&quot;Then we&#39;ll be old maids,&quot; said Jo stoutly.

&quot;Right, Jo.  Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or
unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,&quot; said Mrs. March
decidedly.  &quot;Don&#39;t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere
lover.  Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,
but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave
these things to time.  Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for
homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they
are not.  One thing remember, my girls.  Mother is always ready to be
your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust
that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and
comfort of our lives.&quot;

&quot;We will, Marmee, we will!&quot; cried both, with all their hearts, as she
bade them good night.



CHAPTER TEN

THE P.C. AND P.O.

As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the
lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.
The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the
little plot to do what she liked with.  Hannah used to say, &quot;I&#39;d know
which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see &#39;em in Chiny,&quot; and so
she might, for the girls&#39; tastes differed as much as their characters.
Meg&#39;s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.
Jo&#39;s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying
experiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the
seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed Aunt
Cockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned fragrant
flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,
pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for
the pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but
very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging
their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall
white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants
as would consent to blossom there.

Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine
days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some
new, all more or less original.  One of these was the &#39;P.C.&#39;, for as
secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,
and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the
Pickwick Club.  With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a
year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which
occasions the ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged
in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,
with a big &#39;P.C.&#39; in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper
called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,
while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven
o&#39;clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges
round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity.  Meg, as
the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus
Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,
who was always trying to do what she couldn&#39;t, was Nathaniel Winkle.
Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original
tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which
they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short
comings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles
without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared
hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he
arranged himself properly, began to read:

    _________________________________________________

    &quot;THE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO&quot;



    MAY 20, 18--

    POET&#39;S CORNER

    ANNIVERSARY ODE


    Again we meet to celebrate
    With badge and solemn rite,
    Our fifty-second anniversary,
    In Pickwick Hall, tonight.

    We all are here in perfect health,
    None gone from our small band:
    Again we see each well-known face,
    And press each friendly hand.

    Our Pickwick, always at his post,
    With reverence we greet,
    As, spectacles on nose, he reads
    Our well-filled weekly sheet.

    Although he suffers from a cold,
    We joy to hear him speak,
    For words of wisdom from him fall,
    In spite of croak or squeak.

    Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,
    With elephantine grace,
    And beams upon the company,
    With brown and jovial face.

    Poetic fire lights up his eye,
    He struggles &#39;gainst his lot.
    Behold ambition on his brow,
    And on his nose, a blot.

    Next our peaceful Tupman comes,
    So rosy, plump, and sweet,
    Who chokes with laughter at the puns,
    And tumbles off his seat.

    Prim little Winkle too is here,
    With every hair in place,
    A model of propriety,
    Though he hates to wash his face.

    The year is gone, we still unite
    To joke and laugh and read,
    And tread the path of literature
    That doth to glory lead.

    Long may our paper prosper well,
    Our club unbroken be,
    And coming years their blessings pour
    On the useful, gay &#39;P.  C.&#39;.

    THE MASKED MARRIAGE
    (A Tale Of Venice)

    Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble
    steps, and left its lovely load to swell the
    brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count
    Adelon.  Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks
    and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.
    Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so
    with mirth and music the masquerade went on.
    &quot;Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?&quot;
    asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who
    floated down the hall upon his arm.

    &quot;Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!  Her
    dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds
    Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.&quot;

    &quot;By my faith, I envy him.  Yonder he comes,
    arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.
    When that is off we shall see how he regards the
    fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her
    stern father bestows her hand,&quot; returned the troubadour.

    &quot;Tis whispered that she loves the young English
    artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the
    old Count,&quot; said the lady, as they joined the dance.
    The revel was at its height when a priest
    appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,
    hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.
    Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a
    sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of
    orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the
    hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:

    &quot;My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which
    I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of
    my daughter.  Father, we wait your services.&quot;
    All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a
    murmur of amazement went through the throng, for
    neither bride nor groom removed their masks.  Curiosity
    and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained
    all tongues till the holy rite was over.  Then the
    eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding
    an explanation.

    &quot;Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only
    know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I
    yielded to it.  Now, my children, let the play end.
    Unmask and receive my blessing.&quot;

    But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom
    replied in a tone that startled all listeners
    as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand
    Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the
    breast where now flashed the star of an English earl
    was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.

    &quot;My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your
    daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a
    fortune as the Count Antonio.  I can do more, for even
    your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux
    and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless
    wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,
    now my wife.&quot;

    The count stood like one changed to stone, and
    turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with
    a gay smile of triumph, &quot;To you, my gallant friends, I
    can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has
    done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have
    by this masked marriage.&quot;

    THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH


    Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed
    in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became
    a vine and bore many squashes.  One day in October,
    when they were ripe, he picked one and took it
    to market.  A grocerman bought and put it in his shop.
    That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat
    and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went
    and bought it for her mother.  She lugged it home, cut
    it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it
    with salt and butter, for dinner.  And to the rest she added
    a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,
    and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it
    till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten
    by a family named March.

    A SAD ACCIDENT

    On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock
    in our basement, followed by cries of distress.
    On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved
    President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and
    fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes.  A perfect
    scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick
    had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,
    upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,  and torn
    his garments badly.  On being removed from this perilous
    situation, it was discovered that he had suffered
    no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,
    is now doing well.

    THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT

    It is our painful duty to record the sudden and
    mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs.
    Snowball Pat Paw.  This lovely and beloved cat was the
    pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for
    her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues
    endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt
    by the whole community.

    When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching
    the butcher&#39;s cart, and it is feared that some villain,
    tempted by her charms, basely stole her.  Weeks have passed,
    but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish
    all hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her
    dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever.

    _________

    A sympathizing friend sends the following gem:


    A LAMENT
    (FOR S.  B.  PAT PAW)

    We mourn the loss of our little pet,
    And sigh o&#39;er her hapless fate,
    For never more by the fire she&#39;ll sit,
    Nor play by the old green gate.

    The little grave where her infant sleeps
    Is &#39;neath the chestnut tree.
    But o&#39;er her grave we may not weep,
    We know not where it may be.

    Her empty bed, her idle ball,
    Will never see her more;
    No gentle tap, no loving purr
    Is heard at the parlor door.

    Another cat comes after her mice,
    A cat with a dirty face,
    But she does not hunt as our darling did,
    Nor play with her airy grace.

    Her stealthy paws tread the very hall
    Where Snowball used to play,
    But she only spits at the dogs our pet
    So gallantly drove away.

    She is useful and mild, and does her best,
    But she is not fair to see,
    And we cannot give her your place dear,
    Nor worship her as we worship thee.

    WEEKLY REPORT

    Amy--Middling.

    _________________________________________________


As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to
assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls
once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass
rose to make a proposition.

&quot;Mr. President and gentlemen,&quot; he began, assuming a parliamentary
attitude and tone, &quot;I wish to propose the admission of a new
member--one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for
it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary
value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice.  I propose Mr.
Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P.  C.  Come now, do
have him.&quot;

Jo&#39;s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather
anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.

&quot;We&#39;ll put it to a vote,&quot; said the President.  &quot;All in favor of this
motion please to manifest it by saying, &#39;Aye&#39;.&quot;

A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody&#39;s surprise, by a
timid one from Beth.

&quot;Contrary-minded say, &#39;No&#39;.&quot;

Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great
elegance, &quot;We don&#39;t wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about.
This is a ladies&#39; club, and we wish to be private and proper.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,&quot;
observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she
always did when doubtful.

Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.  &quot;Sir, I give you my word as a
gentleman, Laurie won&#39;t do anything of the sort.  He likes to write,
and he&#39;ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being
sentimental, don&#39;t you see?  We can do so little for him, and he does
so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place
here, and make him welcome if he comes.&quot;

This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,
looking as if he had quite made up his mind.

&quot;Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.  I say he may come, and
his grandpa, too, if he likes.&quot;

This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her
seat to shake hands approvingly.  &quot;Now then, vote again. Everybody
remember it&#39;s our Laurie, and say, &#39;Aye!&#39;&quot; cried Snodgrass excitedly.

&quot;Aye!  Aye!  Aye!&quot; replied three voices at once.

&quot;Good!  Bless you!  Now, as there&#39;s nothing like &#39;taking time by the
fetlock&#39;, as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present
the new member.&quot;  And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw
open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag,
flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.

&quot;You rogue!  You traitor!  Jo, how could you?&quot; cried the three girls,
as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a
chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.

&quot;The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,&quot; began Mr. Pickwick,
trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an
amiable smile.  But the new member was equal to the occasion, and
rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most
engaging manner, &quot;Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,
gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble
servant of the club.&quot;

&quot;Good!  Good!&quot; cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming
pan on which she leaned.

&quot;My faithful friend and noble patron,&quot; continued Laurie with a wave of
the hand, &quot;who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed
for the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and she only gave in
after lots of teasing.&quot;

&quot;Come now, don&#39;t lay it all on yourself.  You know I proposed the
cupboard,&quot; broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.

&quot;Never mind what she says.  I&#39;m the wretch that did it, sir,&quot; said the
new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  &quot;But on my honor,
I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest
of this immortal club.&quot;

&quot;Hear!  Hear!&quot; cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a
cymbal.

&quot;Go on, go on!&quot; added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed
benignly.

&quot;I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the
honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between
adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the
lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on
the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I
may be allowed the expression.  It&#39;s the old martin house, but I&#39;ve
stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts
of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,
and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it
will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to present the club key,
and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.&quot;

Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and
subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some
time before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and
everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an
unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it
broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.

No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,
well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did
add &#39;spirit&#39; to the meetings, and &#39;a tone&#39; to the paper, for his
orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,
being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never
sentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or
Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.

The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished
wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as
through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and
pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,
invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,
and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and
funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah&#39;s
charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo&#39;s care.  How they laughed
when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that
little post office would hold in the years to come.



CHAPTER ELEVEN

EXPERIMENTS

&quot;The first of June!  The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and
I&#39;m free.  Three months&#39; vacation--how I shall enjoy it!&quot; exclaimed
Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an
unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and
Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.

&quot;Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!&quot; said Jo. &quot;I was
mortally afraid she&#39;d ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have
felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a
churchyard, you know, and I&#39;d rather be excused. We had a flurry
getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to
me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly
helpful and sweet, and feared she&#39;d find it impossible to part from me.
I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,
for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, &#39;Josyphine, won&#39;t
you--?&#39; I didn&#39;t hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did
actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.&quot;

&quot;Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,&quot; said
Beth, as she cuddled her sister&#39;s feet with a motherly air.

&quot;Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?&quot; observed Amy, tasting
her mixture critically.

&quot;She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn&#39;t matter.  It&#39;s too warm
to be particular about one&#39;s parts of speech,&quot; murmured Jo.

&quot;What shall you do all your vacation?&quot; asked Amy, changing the subject
with tact.

&quot;I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,&quot; replied Meg, from the depths
of the rocking chair.  &quot;I&#39;ve been routed up early all winter and had to
spend my days working for other people, so now I&#39;m going to rest and
revel to my heart&#39;s content.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Jo, &quot;that dozy way wouldn&#39;t suit me.  I&#39;ve laid in a heap of
books, and I&#39;m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in
the old apple tree, when I&#39;m not having l----&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say &#39;larks!&#39;&quot; implored Amy, as a return snub for the &#39;samphire&#39;
correction.

&quot;I&#39;ll say &#39;nightingales&#39; then, with Laurie.  That&#39;s proper and
appropriate, since he&#39;s a warbler.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time
and rest, as the girls mean to,&quot; proposed Amy.

&quot;Well, I will, if Mother doesn&#39;t mind.  I want to learn some new songs,
and my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully
out of order and really suffering for clothes.&quot;

&quot;May we, Mother?&quot; asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in
what they called &#39;Marmee&#39;s corner&#39;.

&quot;You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I
think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as
bad as all work and no play.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I&#39;m sure,&quot; said Meg complacently.

&quot;I now propose a toast, as my &#39;friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp&#39;, says.
Fun forever, and no grubbing!&quot; cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the
lemonade went round.

They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the
rest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o&#39;clock.
Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely
and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and
Amy&#39;s books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but
&#39;Marmee&#39;s corner&#39;, which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to &#39;rest
and read&#39;, which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses
she would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with
Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide
World_, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out
of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before
half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her
music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her
bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to
draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who
the young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive
daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,
got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.

At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a
delightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the
afternoon and got a &#39;sweet blue muslin&#39;, had discovered, after she had
cut the breadths off, that it wouldn&#39;t wash, which mishap made her
slightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a
raging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion
of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at
once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy
Brown&#39;s party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she
had &#39;nothing to wear&#39;.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured
their mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said
nothing, and with Hannah&#39;s help did their neglected work, keeping home
pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was
astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was
produced by the &#39;resting and reveling&#39; process.  The days kept getting
longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were
tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found
plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,
Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,
that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to
furbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she
was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a
quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished
she had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was
constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell
back into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected
her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so
that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her
she was &#39;a fright&#39;.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were
small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found
that accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn&#39;t
like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn&#39;t draw all the
time.  Tea parties didn&#39;t amount to much, neither did picnics, unless
very well conducted.  &quot;If one could have a fine house, full of nice
girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at
home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try
the patience of a Boaz,&quot; complained Miss Malaprop, after several days
devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.

No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday
night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was
nearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who
had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an
appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls
enjoy the full effect of the play system.

When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,
no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.

&quot;Mercy on us!  What has happened?&quot; cried Jo, staring about her in
dismay.

Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather
bewildered, and a little ashamed.

&quot;Mother isn&#39;t sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay
quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It&#39;s a very
queer thing for her to do, she doesn&#39;t act a bit like herself.  But she
says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn&#39;t grumble but take
care of ourselves.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s easy enough, and I like the idea, I&#39;m aching for something to
do, that is, some new amusement, you know,&quot; added Jo quickly.

In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and
they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah&#39;s
saying, &quot;Housekeeping ain&#39;t no joke.&quot;  There was plenty of food in the
larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,
wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.

&quot;I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think
of her, for she&#39;d take care of herself,&quot; said Meg, who presided and
felt quite matronly behind the teapot.

So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the
cook&#39;s compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet
scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March
received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo
was gone.

&quot;Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I&#39;m afraid, but they
won&#39;t suffer, and it will do them good,&quot; she said, producing the more
palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of
the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly
little deception for which they were grateful.

Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook
at her failures.  &quot;Never mind, I&#39;ll get the dinner and be servant, you
be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,&quot; said
Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.

This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the
parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the
sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with
perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the
quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to
dinner.

&quot;You&#39;d better see what you have got before you think of having
company,&quot; said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.

&quot;Oh, there&#39;s corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some
asparagus and a lobster, &#39;for a relish&#39;, as Hannah says. We&#39;ll have
lettuce and make a salad.  I don&#39;t know how, but the book tells.  I&#39;ll
have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you
want to be elegant.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t try too many messes, Jo, for you can&#39;t make anything but
gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the
dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own
responsibility, you may just take care of him.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the
pudding.  You&#39;ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won&#39;t you?&quot;
asked Jo, rather hurt.

&quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You
had better ask Mother&#39;s leave before you order anything,&quot; returned Meg
prudently.

&quot;Of course I shall.  I&#39;m not a fool.&quot;  And Jo went off in a huff at the
doubts expressed of her powers.

&quot;Get what you like, and don&#39;t disturb me.  I&#39;m going out to dinner and
can&#39;t worry about things at home,&quot; said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to
her.  &quot;I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I&#39;m going to take a vacation
today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.&quot;

The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and
reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural
phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic
eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.

&quot;Everything is out of sorts, somehow,&quot; she said to herself, going
downstairs.  &quot;There&#39;s Beth crying, that&#39;s a sure sign that something is
wrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I&#39;ll shake her.&quot;

Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to
find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with
his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for
want of which he had died.

&quot;It&#39;s all my fault, I forgot him, there isn&#39;t a seed or a drop left.
Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?&quot; cried Beth, taking
the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.

Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding
him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a
coffin.

&quot;Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,&quot; said Amy
hopefully.

&quot;He&#39;s been starved, and he shan&#39;t be baked now he&#39;s dead.  I&#39;ll make
him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I&#39;ll never have
another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,&quot; murmured
Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.

&quot;The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don&#39;t
cry, Bethy.  It&#39;s a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has
had the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my
box, and after the dinner party, we&#39;ll have a nice little funeral,&quot;
said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.

Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which
was in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,
she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when
she discovered that the fire was out.

&quot;Here&#39;s a sweet prospect!&quot; muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,
and poking vigorously among the cinders.

Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the
water heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself
that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a
very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid
strawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and
the stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had
worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and
forgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when
the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure
appeared, demanding tartly...

&quot;I say, isn&#39;t bread &#39;riz&#39; enough when it runs over the pans?&quot;

Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high
as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the
sour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,
after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a
word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear
departed lay in state in the domino box.  A straLanguage cannot describe
nge sense of
helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the
corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker
appeared, and said she&#39;d come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,
yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw
everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had
been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and
had few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain
her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories
of the people whom she knew.

Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions
which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a
standing joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,
and discovered that something more than energy and good will is
necessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was
grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.
The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that
she could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to
her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager
proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had
to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at
the last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe
as they looked, having been skilfully &#39;deaconed&#39;.

&quot;Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only
it&#39;s mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,&quot;
thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and
stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before
Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose
tattling tongue would report them far and wide.

Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after
another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,
Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all
his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo&#39;s one
strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a
pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,
and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and
everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea
of cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some
water hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,
for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but
he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his
mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of
delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her
napkin, and left the table precipitately.

&quot;Oh, what is it?&quot; exclaimed Jo, trembling.

&quot;Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,&quot; replied Meg with a
tragic gesture.

Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had
given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes
on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the
refrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when
she met Laurie&#39;s eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic
efforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she
laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even
&#39;Croaker&#39; as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner
ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.

&quot;I haven&#39;t strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober
ourselves with a funeral,&quot; said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made
ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend&#39;s
dinner table.

They did sober themselves for Beth&#39;s sake.  Laurie dug a grave under
the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his
tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of
violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,
composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.

    Here lies Pip March,
    Who died the 7th of June;
    Loved and lamented sore,
    And not forgotten soon.

At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome
with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the
beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up
the pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the
remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so
tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.

Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour
cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came
home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the
afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success
of one part of the experiment.

Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was
a scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands
done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last
minute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on
the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each
groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.

&quot;What a dreadful day this has been!&quot; began Jo, usually the first to
speak.

&quot;It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,&quot; said Meg.

&quot;Not a bit like home,&quot; added Amy.

&quot;It can&#39;t seem so without Marmee and little Pip,&quot; sighed Beth, glancing
with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.

&quot;Here&#39;s Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you
want it.&quot;

As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as
if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.

&quot;Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another
week of it?&quot; she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned
toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.

&quot;I don&#39;t!&quot; cried Jo decidedly.

&quot;Nor I,&quot; echoed the others.

&quot;You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a
little for others, do you?&quot;

&quot;Lounging and larking doesn&#39;t pay,&quot; observed Jo, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;m
tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.&quot;

&quot;Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That&#39;s a useful accomplishment,
which no woman should be without,&quot; said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly
at the recollection of Jo&#39;s dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker
and heard her account of it.

&quot;Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we&#39;d
get on?&quot; cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.

&quot;Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing
her share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on
pretty well, though I don&#39;t think you were very happy or amiable.  So I
thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when
everyone thinks only of herself.  Don&#39;t you feel that it is pleasanter
to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when
it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and
lovely to us all?&quot;

&quot;We do, Mother, we do!&quot; cried the girls.

&quot;Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for
though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as
we learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for
everyone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and
spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than
money or fashion.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don&#39;t,&quot; said Jo.
&quot;I&#39;ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner
party I have shall be a success.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,
Marmee.  I can and I will, though I&#39;m not fond of sewing. That will be
better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as
they are.&quot; said Meg.

&quot;I&#39;ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music
and dolls.  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not
playing,&quot; was Beth&#39;s resolution, while Amy followed their example by
heroically declaring, &quot;I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to
my parts of speech.&quot;

&quot;Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy
that we shall not have to repeat it, only don&#39;t go to the other extreme
and delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each
day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth
of time by employing it well.  Then youth will be delightful, old age
will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite
of poverty.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll remember, Mother!&quot; and they did.



CHAPTER TWELVE

CAMP LAURENCE

Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it
regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door
and distributing the mail.  One July day she came in with her hands
full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the
penny post.

&quot;Here&#39;s your posy, Mother!  Laurie never forgets that,&quot; she said,
putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in &#39;Marmee&#39;s corner&#39;,
and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.

&quot;Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,&quot; continued Beth, delivering
the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching
wristbands.

&quot;Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,&quot; said Meg,
looking at the gray cotton glove.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you drop the other in the
garden?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t, for there was only one in the office.&quot;

&quot;I hate to have odd gloves!  Never mind, the other may be found.  My
letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted.  I think Mr.
Brooke did it, for this isn&#39;t Laurie&#39;s writing.&quot;

Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham
morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and
very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy
white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother&#39;s mind as she
sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied
with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt,
that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.

&quot;Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered
the whole post office and stuck outside,&quot; said Beth, laughing as she
went into the study where Jo sat writing.

&quot;What a sly fellow Laurie is!  I said I wished bigger hats were the
fashion, because I burn my face every hot day.  He said, &#39;Why mind the
fashion?  Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!&#39; I said I would if I had
one, and he has sent me this, to try me.  I&#39;ll wear it for fun, and
show him I don&#39;t care for the fashion.&quot;  And hanging the antique
broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.

One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said
to her...


My Dear:

I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch
your efforts to control your temper.  You say nothing about your
trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees
them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the
well-worn cover of your guidebook.  I, too, have seen them all, and
heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins
to bear fruit.  Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe
that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...

Mother


&quot;That does me good!  That&#39;s worth millions of money and pecks of
praise.  Oh, Marmee, I do try!  I will keep on trying, and not get
tired, since I have you to help me.&quot;

Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy
tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts
to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,
because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most
valued.  Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon,
she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest
she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite
ready for either good or bad news.  In a big, dashing hand, Laurie
wrote...

Dear Jo, What ho!

Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to
have a jolly time.  If it&#39;s fine, I&#39;m going to pitch my tent in
Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet--have a
fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.  They are
nice people, and like such things.  Brooke will go to keep us boys
steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls.  I want you
all to come, can&#39;t let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry
her.  Don&#39;t bother about rations, I&#39;ll see to that and everything else,
only do come, there&#39;s a good fellow!

In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.

&quot;Here&#39;s richness!&quot; cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.

&quot;Of course we can go, Mother?  It will be such a help to Laurie, for I
can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some
way.&quot;

&quot;I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.  Do you know anything
about them, Jo?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;Only that there are four of them.  Kate is older than you, Fred and
Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or
ten.  Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.  I fancied, from the
way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn&#39;t admire
Kate much.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad my French print is clean, it&#39;s just the thing and so
becoming!&quot; observed Meg complacently.  &quot;Have you anything decent, Jo?&quot;

&quot;Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.  I shall row and
tramp about, so I don&#39;t want any starch to think of.  You&#39;ll come,
Betty?&quot;

&quot;If you won&#39;t let any boys talk to me.&quot;

&quot;Not a boy!&quot;

&quot;I like to please Laurie, and I&#39;m not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so
kind.  But I don&#39;t want to play, or sing, or say anything. I&#39;ll work
hard and not trouble anyone, and you&#39;ll take care of me, Jo, so I&#39;ll
go.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my good girl.  You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love
you for it.  Fighting faults isn&#39;t easy, as I know, and a cheery word
kind of gives a lift.  Thank you, Mother,&quot; And Jo gave the thin cheek a
grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back
the rosy roundness of her youth.

&quot;I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,&quot;
said Amy, showing her mail.

&quot;And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to
him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,&quot; added Beth,
whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.

&quot;Now let&#39;s fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play
tomorrow with free minds,&quot; said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a
broom.

When the sun peeped into the girls&#39; room early next morning to promise
them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.  Each had made such
preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an
extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously
anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to
bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had
capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the
offending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the
paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and
effective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle
appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo
woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy&#39;s ornament.

Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a
lively bustle began in both houses.  Beth, who was ready first, kept
reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters&#39; toilets by
frequent telegrams from the window.

&quot;There goes the man with the tent!  I see Mrs. Barker doing up the
lunch in a hamper and a great basket.  Now Mr. Laurence is looking up
at the sky and the weathercock.  I wish he would go too.  There&#39;s
Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!  Oh, mercy me!  Here&#39;s a
carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful
boys.  One is lame, poor thing, he&#39;s got a crutch. Laurie didn&#39;t tell
us that.  Be quick, girls!  It&#39;s getting late. Why, there is Ned
Moffat, I do declare.  Meg, isn&#39;t that the man who bowed to you one day
when we were shopping?&quot;

&quot;So it is.  How queer that he should come.  I thought he was at the
mountains.  There is Sallie.  I&#39;m glad she got back in time. Am I all
right, Jo?&quot; cried Meg in a flutter.

&quot;A regular daisy.  Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it
looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff.
Now then, come on!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?  It&#39;s too absurd!
You shall not make a guy of yourself,&quot; remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied
down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie
had sent for a joke.

&quot;I just will, though, for it&#39;s capital, so shady, light, and big. It
will make fun, and I don&#39;t mind being a guy if I&#39;m comfortable.&quot; With
that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little
band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy
faces under the jaunty hatbrims.

Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial
manner.  The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a
lively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss
Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls
would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned&#39;s
assurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why
Laurie &#39;primmed up his mouth&#39; when speaking of Kate, for that young
lady had a standoff-don&#39;t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with
the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an
observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not
&#39;dreadful&#39;, but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that
account.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and
after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly
became very good friends.

Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the
party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving
Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.  Laurie and Jo rowed one
boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous
twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a
disturbed water bug.  Jo&#39;s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it
was of general utility.  It broke the ice in the beginning by producing
a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as
she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if
a shower came up, she said.  Miss Kate decided that she was &#39;odd&#39;, but
rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.

Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with
the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with
uncommon &#39;skill and dexterity&#39;.  Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young
man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.  Meg liked his
quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful
knowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good
deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,
being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it
their bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very
good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.
Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and
chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror
by his pranks.

It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets
down by the time they arrived.  A pleasant green field, with three
wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for
croquet.

&quot;Welcome to Camp Laurence!&quot; said the young host, as they landed with
exclamations of delight.

&quot;Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other
fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is
for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is
the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen.  Now, let&#39;s have a game
before it gets hot, and then we&#39;ll see about dinner.&quot;

Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the
other eight.  Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie,
Jo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,
and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of
&#39;76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once
narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had
missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was
close behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his
ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was
very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his
toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.

&quot;I&#39;m through!  Now, Miss Jo, I&#39;ll settle you, and get in first,&quot; cried
the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.

&quot;You pushed it.  I saw you.  It&#39;s my turn now,&quot; said Jo sharply.

&quot;Upon my word, I didn&#39;t move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is
allowed.  So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,&quot; said Jo
angrily.

&quot;Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.  There you go!&quot;
returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.

Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,
colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket
with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out
with much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long
time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and
quiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to
regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side
had nearly won, for Kate&#39;s ball was the last but one and lay near the
stake.

&quot;By George, it&#39;s all up with us!  Goodbye, Kate.  Miss Jo owes me one,
so you are finished,&quot; cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to
see the finish.

&quot;Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,&quot; said Jo,
with a look that made the lad redden, &quot;especially when they beat them,&quot;
she added, as, leaving Kate&#39;s ball untouched, she won the game by a
clever stroke.

Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn&#39;t do to exult
over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer
to whisper to his friend, &quot;Good for you, Jo!  He did cheat, I saw him.
We can&#39;t tell him so, but he won&#39;t do it again, take my word for it.&quot;

Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and
said approvingly, &quot;It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your
temper, and I&#39;m so glad, Jo.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should
certainly have boiled over if I hadn&#39;t stayed among the nettles till I
got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It&#39;s simmering now,
so I hope he&#39;ll keep out of my way,&quot; returned Jo, biting her lips as
she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.

&quot;Time for lunch,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. &quot;Commissary
general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss
Sallie, and I spread the table?  Who can make good coffee?&quot;

&quot;Jo can,&quot; said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that
her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over
the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys
made a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched
and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes
to serve as plates.

The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an
inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with
green leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone
settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and
exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for
everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter
startled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing
inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and
plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the
refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down
from the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children
peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the
other side of the river with all his might and main.

&quot;There&#39;s salt here,&quot; said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.

&quot;Thank you, I prefer spiders,&quot; she replied, fishing up two unwary
little ones who had gone to a creamy death.  &quot;How dare you remind me of
that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?&quot; added
Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run
short.

&quot;I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven&#39;t got over it yet.
This is no credit to me, you know, I don&#39;t do anything.  It&#39;s you and
Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I&#39;m no end obliged to you.  What
shall we do when we can&#39;t eat anymore?&quot; asked Laurie, feeling that his
trump card had been played when lunch was over.

&quot;Have games till it&#39;s cooler.  I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss
Kate knows something new and nice.  Go and ask her.  She&#39;s company, and
you ought to stay with her more.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you company too?  I thought she&#39;d suit Brooke, but he keeps
talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous
glass of hers.  I&#39;m going, so you needn&#39;t try to preach propriety, for
you can&#39;t do it, Jo.&quot;

Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and
the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing
room to play Rig-marole.

&quot;One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as
he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when
the next takes it up and does the same.  It&#39;s very funny when well
done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh
over.  Please start it, Mr. Brooke,&quot; said Kate, with a commanding air,
which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any
other gentleman.

Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke
obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed
upon the sunshiny river.

&quot;Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,
for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long
while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till
he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to
anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he
was very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,
for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new
master, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his
lessons to this pet of the king&#39;s, the knight rode him through the
city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful
face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One
day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a
ruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived
in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were
kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their
liberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he
was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and
longing to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into
the castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The
great door flew open, and he beheld...&quot;

&quot;A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, &#39;At
last!  At last!&#39;&quot; continued Kate, who had read French novels, and
admired the style.  &quot;&#39;Tis she!&#39; cried Count Gustave, and fell at her
feet in an ecstasy of joy.  &#39;Oh, rise!&#39; she said, extending a hand of
marble fairness.  &#39;Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,&#39; swore
the knight, still kneeling. &#39;Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain
here till my tyrant is destroyed.&#39; &#39;Where is the villain?&#39; &#39;In the
mauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.&#39; &#39;I obey, and
return victorious or dead!&#39; With these thrilling words he rushed away,
and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when
he received...&quot;

&quot;A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a
black gown fired at him,&quot; said Ned.  &quot;Instantly, Sir What&#39;s-his-name
recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to
join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door
locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when
the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet
below.  Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came
to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads
together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling
exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a
pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as
your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss
March.  At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took
his breath away and chilled his blood...&quot;

&quot;A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in
its wasted hand,&quot; went on Meg.  &quot;It beckoned, gliding noiselessly
before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.  Shadowy
effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the
lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face
toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil.
They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.  He
sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved
threateningly before him a...&quot;

&quot;Snuffbox,&quot; said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the
audience.  &quot;&#39;Thankee,&#39; said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and
sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.  &#39;Ha! Ha!&#39;
laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the
princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her
victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other
knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all
rose and began to...&quot;

&quot;Dance a hornpipe,&quot; cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, &quot;and, as they
danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail.
&#39;Up with the jib, reef the tops&#39;l halliards, helm hard alee, and man
the guns!&#39; roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight,
with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. &#39;Go in and win, my
hearties!&#39; says the captain, and a tremendous fight began.  Of course
the British beat--they always do.&quot;

&quot;No, they don&#39;t!&quot; cried Jo, aside.

&quot;Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the
schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers
ran blood, for the order had been &#39;Cutlasses, and die hard!&#39; &#39;Bosun&#39;s
mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if
he doesn&#39;t confess his sins double quick,&#39; said the British captain.
The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,
while the jolly tars cheered like mad.  But the sly dog dived, came up
under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail
set, &#39;To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea&#39; where...&quot;

&quot;Oh, gracious!  What shall I say?&quot; cried Sallie, as Fred ended his
rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases
and facts out of one of his favorite books. &quot;Well, they went to the
bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on
finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,
hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was
curious.  By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, &#39;I&#39;ll give
you a box of pearls if you can take it up,&#39; for she wanted to restore
the poor things to life, and couldn&#39;t raise the heavy load herself.  So
the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to
find no pearls.  He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found
by a...&quot;

&quot;Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,&quot; said
Amy, when Sallie&#39;s invention gave out.  &quot;The little girl was sorry for
them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them.  &#39;Your
geese will tell you, they know everything.&#39; said the old woman.  So she
asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,
and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...&quot;

&quot;&#39;Cabbages!&#39;&quot; continued Laurie promptly.  &quot;&#39;Just the thing,&#39; said the
girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,
the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way
rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other
heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it.  The
knight in whom I&#39;m interested went back to find the pretty face, and
learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and
married, but one.  He was in a great state of mind at that, and
mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to
the castle to see which was left.  Peeping over the hedge, he saw the
queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden.  &#39;Will you give
me a rose?&#39; said he.  &#39;You must come and get it.  I can&#39;t come to you,
it isn&#39;t proper,&#39; said she, as sweet as honey.  He tried to climb over
the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.  Then he tried to
push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.
So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole
through which he peeped, saying imploringly, &#39;Let me in!  Let me in!&#39;
But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her
roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.  Whether he did or
not, Frank will tell you.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t.  I&#39;m not playing, I never do,&quot; said Frank, dismayed at the
sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd
couple.  Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.

&quot;So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?&quot; asked
Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in
his buttonhole.

&quot;I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a
while,&quot; said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his
tutor.

&quot;What a piece of nonsense we have made!  With practice we might do
something quite clever.  Do you know Truth?&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Meg soberly.

&quot;The game, I mean?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; said Fred.

&quot;Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn,
and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question
put by the rest.  It&#39;s great fun.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s try it,&quot; said Jo, who liked new experiments.

Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,
and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.

&quot;Who are your heroes?&quot; asked Jo.

&quot;Grandfather and Napoleon.&quot;

&quot;Which lady here do you think prettiest?&quot; said Sallie.

&quot;Margaret.&quot;

&quot;Which do you like best?&quot; from Fred.

&quot;Jo, of course.&quot;

&quot;What silly questions you ask!&quot;  And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the
rest laughed at Laurie&#39;s matter-of-fact tone.

&quot;Try again.  Truth isn&#39;t a bad game,&quot; said Fred.

&quot;It&#39;s a very good one for you,&quot; retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn
came next.

&quot;What is your greatest fault?&quot; asked Fred, by way of testing in her the
virtue he lacked himself.

&quot;A quick temper.&quot;

&quot;What do you most wish for?&quot; said Laurie.

&quot;A pair of boot lacings,&quot; returned Jo, guessing and defeating his
purpose.

&quot;Not a true answer.  You must say what you really do want most.&quot;

&quot;Genius.  Don&#39;t you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?&quot; And she
slyly smiled in his disappointed face.

&quot;What virtues do you most admire in a man?&quot; asked Sallie.

&quot;Courage and honesty.&quot;

&quot;Now my turn,&quot; said Fred, as his hand came last.

&quot;Let&#39;s give it to him,&quot; whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at
once...

&quot;Didn&#39;t you cheat at croquet?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes, a little bit.&quot;

&quot;Good!  Didn&#39;t you take your story out of _The Sea Lion?_&quot; said Laurie.

&quot;Rather.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think the English nation perfect in every respect?&quot; asked
Sallie.

&quot;I should be ashamed of myself if I didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a true John Bull.  Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance
without waiting to draw.  I&#39;ll harrrow up your feelings first by asking
if you don&#39;t think you are something of a flirt,&quot; said Laurie, as Jo
nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.

&quot;You impertinent boy!  Of course I&#39;m not,&quot; exclaimed Sallie, with an
air that proved the contrary.

&quot;What do you hate most?&quot; asked Fred.

&quot;Spiders and rice pudding.&quot;

&quot;What do you like best?&quot; asked Jo.

&quot;Dancing and French gloves.&quot;

&quot;Well, I think Truth is a very silly play.  Let&#39;s have a sensible game
of Authors to refresh our minds,&quot; proposed Jo.

Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on,
the three elders sat apart, talking.  Miss Kate took out her sketch
again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with
a book, which he did not read.

&quot;How beautifully you do it!  I wish I could draw,&quot; said Meg, with
mingled admiration and regret in her voice.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you learn?  I should think you had taste and talent for it,&quot;
replied Miss Kate graciously.

&quot;I haven&#39;t time.&quot;

&quot;Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.  So did mine, but I
proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and
then she was quite willing I should go on.  Can&#39;t you do the same with
your governess?&quot;

&quot;I have none.&quot;

&quot;I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with us.  Very
fine schools they are, too, Papa says.  You go to a private one, I
suppose?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t go at all.  I am a governess myself.&quot;

&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, &quot;Dear
me, how dreadful!&quot; for her tone implied it, and something in her face
made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.

Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, &quot;Young ladies in America love
independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and
respected for supporting themselves.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, of course it&#39;s very nice and proper in them to do so.  We
have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and
are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of
gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,&quot; said
Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg&#39;s pride, and made her
work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.

&quot;Did the German song suit, Miss March?&quot; inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking
an awkward pause.

&quot;Oh, yes!  It was very sweet, and I&#39;m much obliged to whoever
translated it for me.&quot; And Meg&#39;s downcast face brightened as she spoke.

&quot;Don&#39;t you read German?&quot; asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.

&quot;Not very well.  My father, who taught me, is away, and I don&#39;t get on
very fast alone, for I&#39;ve no one to correct my pronunciation.&quot;

&quot;Try a little now.  Here is Schiller&#39;s Mary Stuart and a tutor who
loves to teach.&quot;  And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an
inviting smile.

&quot;It&#39;s so hard I&#39;m afraid to try,&quot; said Meg, grateful, but bashful in
the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.

&quot;I&#39;ll read a bit to encourage you.&quot; And Miss Kate read one of the most
beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless
manner.

Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said
innocently, &quot;I thought it was poetry.&quot;

&quot;Some of it is.  Try this passage.&quot;

There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke&#39;s mouth as he opened at poor
Mary&#39;s lament.

Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used
to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of
the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.  Down the
page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in
the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little
touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen
the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked
up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.

&quot;Very well indeed!&quot; said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her
many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.

Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little
tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,
&quot;You&#39;ve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader.  I advise
you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers.  I
must look after Grace, she is romping.&quot; And Miss Kate strolled away,
adding to herself with a shrug, &quot;I didn&#39;t come to chaperone a
governess, though she is young and pretty.  What odd people these
Yankees are.  I&#39;m afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.&quot;

&quot;I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses
and don&#39;t treat them as we do,&quot; said Meg, looking after the retreating
figure with an annoyed expression.

&quot;Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my
sorrow.  There&#39;s no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.&quot;
And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to
lament her hard lot.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I live in it then.  I don&#39;t like my work, but I get a good
deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won&#39;t complain. I only
wished I liked teaching as you do.&quot;

&quot;I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.  I shall be very
sorry to lose him next year,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in
the turf.

&quot;Going to college, I suppose?&quot; Meg&#39;s lips asked the question, but her
eyes added, &quot;And what becomes of you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is
off, I shall turn soldier.  I am needed.&quot;

&quot;I am glad of that!&quot; exclaimed Meg.  &quot;I should think every young man
would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who
stay at home,&quot; she added sorrowfully.

&quot;I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,&quot;
said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the
hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.

&quot;Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all
be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,&quot; said Meg heartily.

&quot;Thank you, that sounds pleasant,&quot; began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful
again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old
horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the
young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

&quot;Don&#39;t you love to ride?&quot; asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting
after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.

&quot;I dote upon it.  My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but
we don&#39;t keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,&quot; added Amy, laughing.

&quot;Tell me about Ellen Tree.  Is it a donkey?&quot; asked Grace curiously.

&quot;Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we&#39;ve only got
an old sidesaddle and no horse.  Out in our garden is an apple tree
that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some
reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree
whenever we like.&quot;

&quot;How funny!&quot; laughed Grace.  &quot;I have a pony at home, and ride nearly
every day in the park with Fred and Kate.  It&#39;s very nice, for my
friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.&quot;

&quot;Dear, how charming!  I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I&#39;d rather
go to Rome than the Row,&quot; said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what
the Row was and wouldn&#39;t have asked for the world.

Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were
saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture
as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical
gymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,
looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, &quot;I&#39;m afraid you are
tired.  Can I do anything for you?&quot;

&quot;Talk to me, please.  It&#39;s dull, sitting by myself,&quot; answered Frank,
who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.

If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a
more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,
no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her
that she bravely resolved to try.

&quot;What do you like to talk about?&quot; she asked, fumbling over the cards
and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.

&quot;Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,&quot; said
Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.

My heart!  What shall I do?  I don&#39;t know anything about them, thought
Beth, and forgetting the boy&#39;s misfortune in her flurry, she said,
hoping to make him talk, &quot;I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you
know all about it.&quot;

&quot;I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a
confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for
me,&quot; said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her
innocent blunder.

&quot;Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,&quot; she said,
turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one
of the boys&#39; books in which Jo delighted.

Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to
amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her
sisters&#39; surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking
away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged
protection.

&quot;Bless her heart!  She pities him, so she is good to him,&quot; said Jo,
beaming at her from the croquet ground.

&quot;I always said she was a little saint,&quot; added Meg, as if there could be
no further doubt of it.

&quot;I haven&#39;t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,&quot; said Grace to
Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn
cups.

&quot;My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,&quot; said
Amy, well pleased at Beth&#39;s success.  She meant &#39;facinating&#39;, but as
Grace didn&#39;t know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded
well and made a good impression.

An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet
finished the afternoon.  At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,
wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the
river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,
warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...

    Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,

and at the lines...

    We each are young, we each have a heart,
    Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?

he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed
outright and spoiled his song.

&quot;How can you be so cruel to me?&quot; he whispered, under cover of a lively
chorus.  &quot;You&#39;ve kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,
and now you snub me.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn&#39;t help it,&quot;
replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was
quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and
the talk after it.

Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her
rather pettishly, &quot;There isn&#39;t a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?&quot;

&quot;Not a particle, but she&#39;s a dear,&quot; returned Sallie, defending her
friend even while confessing her shortcomings.

&quot;She&#39;s not a stricken deer anyway,&quot; said Ned, trying to be witty, and
succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.

On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with
cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.
As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked
after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, &quot;In
spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when
one knows them.&quot;

&quot;I quite agree with you,&quot; said Mr. Brooke.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN

CASTLES IN THE AIR

Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm
September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too
lazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had
been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could
live it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had
shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke&#39;s patience to the utmost,
displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened
the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that
one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman
about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his
hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the
peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up
into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed
dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the
ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him
ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw
the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.

&quot;What in the world are those girls about now?&quot; thought Laurie, opening
his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather
peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,
flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried
a long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a
portfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little
back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and
river.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s cool,&quot; said Laurie to himself, &quot;to have a picnic and
never ask me!  They can&#39;t be going in the boat, for they haven&#39;t got
the key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I&#39;ll take it to them, and see what&#39;s
going on.&quot;

Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find
one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in
his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped
the fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the
boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went
up the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part
of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than
the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.

&quot;Here&#39;s a landscape!&quot; thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and
looking wide-awake and good-natured already.

It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in
the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic
wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the
little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no
strangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily
with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her
pink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick
under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy
was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.
A shadow passed over the boy&#39;s face as he watched them, feeling that he
ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed
very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his
restless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its
harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and
skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the
wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.

&quot;May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?&quot; he asked, advancing
slowly.

Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at
once, &quot;Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we
thought you wouldn&#39;t care for such a girl&#39;s game as this.&quot;

&quot;I always like your games, but if Meg doesn&#39;t want me, I&#39;ll go away.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve no objection, if you do something.  It&#39;s against the rules to be
idle here,&quot; replied Meg gravely but graciously.

&quot;Much obliged.  I&#39;ll do anything if you&#39;ll let me stop a bit, for it&#39;s
as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,
draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I&#39;m ready.&quot;  And Laurie
sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.

&quot;Finish this story while I set my heel,&quot; said Jo, handing him the book.

&quot;Yes&#39;m.&quot; was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his
gratitude for the favor of admission into the &#39;Busy Bee Society&#39;.

The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to
ask a few questions as a reward of merit.

&quot;Please, ma&#39;am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming
institution is a new one?&quot;

&quot;Would you tell him?&quot; asked Meg of her sisters.

&quot;He&#39;ll laugh,&quot; said Amy warningly.

&quot;Who cares?&quot; said Jo.

&quot;I guess he&#39;ll like it,&quot; added Beth.

&quot;Of course I shall!  I give you my word I won&#39;t laugh.  Tell away, Jo,
and don&#39;t be afraid.&quot;

&quot;The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play
Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all
winter and summer.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Laurie, nodding wisely.

&quot;Who told you?&quot; demanded Jo.

&quot;Spirits.&quot;

&quot;No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,
and he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don&#39;t scold, Jo,&quot; said
Beth meekly.

&quot;You can&#39;t keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now.&quot;

&quot;Go on, please,&quot; said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,
looking a trifle displeased.

&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have
tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at
it with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,
and we are ever so glad that we didn&#39;t dawdle.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I should think so,&quot; and Laurie thought regretfully of his own
idle days.

&quot;Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring
our work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our
things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,
and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the
Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where
we hope to live some time.&quot;

Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the
wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the
other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green
hills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens
glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset.  Gold and purple clouds
lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery
white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.

&quot;How beautiful that is!&quot; said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see
and feel beauty of any kind.

&quot;It&#39;s often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but
always splendid,&quot; replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.

&quot;Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the real
country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be
nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could
ever go to it,&quot; said Beth musingly.

&quot;There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,
by-and-by, when we are good enough,&quot; answered Meg with her sweetest
voice.

&quot;It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.  I want to fly away at once,
as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,&quot; said Jo.
&quot;I&#39;m the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and
maybe never get in after all.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll have me for company, if that&#39;s any comfort.  I shall have to do
a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City.  If
I arrive late, you&#39;ll say a good word for me, won&#39;t you, Beth?&quot;

Something in the boy&#39;s face troubled his little friend, but she said
cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, &quot;If people
really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will
get in, for I don&#39;t believe there are any locks on that door or any
guards at the gate.  I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,
where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor
Christian as he comes up from the river.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could
come true, and we could live in them?&quot; said Jo, after a little pause.

&quot;I&#39;ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I&#39;d have,&quot;
said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had
betrayed him.

&quot;You&#39;d have to take your favorite one.  What is it?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;If I tell mine, will you tell yours?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if the girls will too.&quot;

&quot;We will.  Now, Laurie.&quot;

&quot;After I&#39;d seen as much of the world as I want to, I&#39;d like to settle
in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.  I&#39;m to be a famous
musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me.  And I&#39;m never
to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live
for what I like.  That&#39;s my favorite castle. What&#39;s yours, Meg?&quot;

Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a
brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she
said slowly, &quot;I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of
luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,
pleasant people, and heaps of money.  I am to be mistress of it, and
manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a
bit.  How I should enjoy it!  For I wouldn&#39;t be idle, but do good, and
make everyone love me dearly.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you have a master for your castle in the air?&quot; asked Laurie
slyly.

&quot;I said &#39;pleasant people&#39;, you know,&quot; and Meg carefully tied up her
shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you say you&#39;d have a splendid, wise, good husband and some
angelic little children?  You know your castle wouldn&#39;t be perfect
without,&quot; said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather
scorned romance, except in books.

&quot;You&#39;d have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,&quot;
answered Meg petulantly.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t I though?  I&#39;d have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms
piled high with books, and I&#39;d write out of a magic inkstand, so that
my works should be as famous as Laurie&#39;s music.  I want to do something
splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that
won&#39;t be forgotten after I&#39;m dead.  I don&#39;t know what, but I&#39;m on the
watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.  I think I shall
write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my
favorite dream.&quot;

&quot;Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take
care of the family,&quot; said Beth contentedly.

&quot;Don&#39;t you wish for anything else?&quot; asked Laurie.

&quot;Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.  I only wish we
may all keep well and be together, nothing else.&quot;

&quot;I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go
to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole
world,&quot; was Amy&#39;s modest desire.

&quot;We&#39;re an ambitious set, aren&#39;t we?  Every one of us, but Beth, wants
to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if
any of us will ever get our wishes,&quot; said Laurie, chewing grass like a
meditative calf.

&quot;I&#39;ve got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the
door remains to be seen,&quot; observed Jo mysteriously.

&quot;I&#39;ve got the key to mine, but I&#39;m not allowed to try it. Hang
college!&quot; muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.

&quot;Here&#39;s mine!&quot; and Amy waved her pencil.

&quot;I haven&#39;t got any,&quot; said Meg forlornly.

&quot;Yes, you have,&quot; said Laurie at once.

&quot;Where?&quot;

&quot;In your face.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense, that&#39;s of no use.&quot;

&quot;Wait and see if it doesn&#39;t bring you something worth having,&quot; replied
the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he
fancied he knew.

Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across
the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn
when he told the story of the knight.

&quot;If we are all alive ten years hence, let&#39;s meet, and see how many of
us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,&quot; said
Jo, always ready with a plan.

&quot;Bless me!  How old I shall be, twenty-seven!&quot; exclaimed Meg, who felt
grown up already, having just reached seventeen.

&quot;You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy
twenty-two.  What a venerable party!&quot; said Jo.

&quot;I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but
I&#39;m such a lazy dog, I&#39;m afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.&quot;

&quot;You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure
you&#39;ll work splendidly.&quot;

&quot;Is she?  By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!&quot; cried Laurie,
sitting up with sudden energy.  &quot;I ought to be satisfied to please
Grandfather, and I do try, but it&#39;s working against the grain, you see,
and comes hard.  He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and
I&#39;d rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of
rubbish his old ships bring, and I don&#39;t care how soon they go to the
bottom when I own them.  Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if
I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But
he&#39;s set, and I&#39;ve got to do just as he did, unless I break away and
please myself, as my father did.  If there was anyone left to stay with
the old gentleman, I&#39;d do it tomorrow.&quot;

Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into
execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast
and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man&#39;s hatred of
subjection, a young man&#39;s restless longing to try the world for himself.

&quot;I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home
again till you have tried your own way,&quot; said Jo, whose imagination was
fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was
excited by what she called &#39;Teddy&#39;s Wrongs&#39;.

&quot;That&#39;s not right, Jo.  You mustn&#39;t talk in that way, and Laurie
mustn&#39;t take your bad advice.  You should do just what your grandfather
wishes, my dear boy,&quot; said Meg in her most maternal tone. &quot;Do your best
at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I&#39;m sure he
won&#39;t be hard on you or unjust to you.  As you say, there is no one
else to stay with and love him, and you&#39;d never forgive yourself if you
left him without his permission.  Don&#39;t be dismal or fret, but do your
duty and you&#39;ll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being
respected and loved.&quot;

&quot;What do you know about him?&quot; asked Laurie, grateful for the good
advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation
from himself after his unusual outbreak.

&quot;Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his
own mother till she died, and wouldn&#39;t go abroad as tutor to some nice
person because he wouldn&#39;t leave her.  And how he provides now for an
old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as
generous and patient and good as he can be.&quot;

&quot;So he is, dear old fellow!&quot; said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,
looking flushed and earnest with her story.  &quot;It&#39;s like Grandpa to find
out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his
goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn&#39;t
understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me
and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was
just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about
you all in flaming style.  If ever I do get my wish, you see what I&#39;ll
do for Brooke.&quot;

&quot;Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,&quot; said Meg
sharply.

&quot;How do you know I do, Miss?&quot;

&quot;I can always tell by his face when he goes away.  If you have been
good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.  If you have plagued him,
he&#39;s sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work
better.&quot;

&quot;Well, I like that?  So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in
Brooke&#39;s face, do you?  I see him bow and smile as he passes your
window, but I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d got up a telegraph.&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t.  Don&#39;t be angry, and oh, don&#39;t tell him I said anything!
It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here
is said in confidence, you know,&quot; cried Meg, much alarmed at the
thought of what might follow from her careless speech.

&quot;I don&#39;t tell tales,&quot; replied Laurie, with his &#39;high and mighty&#39; air,
as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. &quot;Only if
Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather
for him to report.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t be offended.  I didn&#39;t mean to preach or tell tales or be
silly.  I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you&#39;d
be sorry for by-and-by.  You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were
our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.&quot;
And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.

Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,
and said frankly, &quot;I&#39;m the one to be forgiven.  I&#39;m cross and have been
out of sorts all day.  I like to have you tell me my faults and be
sisterly, so don&#39;t mind if I am grumpy sometimes.  I thank you all the
same.&quot;

Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable
as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook
down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a
fit person to belong to the &#39;Busy Bee Society&#39;.  In the midst of an
animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those
amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound
of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea &#39;to draw&#39;, and they
would just have time to get home to supper.

&quot;May I come again?&quot; asked Laurie.

&quot;Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer
are told to do,&quot; said Meg, smiling.

&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

&quot;Then you may come, and I&#39;ll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.
There&#39;s a demand for socks just now,&quot; added Jo, waving hers like a big
blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.

That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,
standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,
whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old
man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts
of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of
the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the
sacrifice cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear
old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.&quot;



CHAPTER FOURTEEN

SECRETS

Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow
chilly, and the afternoons were short.  For two or three hours the sun
lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,
writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,
while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied
by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of
his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the
last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and
threw down her pen, exclaiming...

&quot;There, I&#39;ve done my best!  If this won&#39;t suit I shall have to wait
till I can do better.&quot;

Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,
making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,
which looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart
red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful
expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo&#39;s
desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it
she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,
who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a
circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the
leaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and
putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her
friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.

She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to
the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung
herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled
away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.

If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements
decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till
she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found
the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up
the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly
dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This
maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a
black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building
opposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,
pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if
she were going to have all her teeth out.

There was a dentist&#39;s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,
and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly
opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young
gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself
in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, &quot;It&#39;s like
her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she&#39;ll need someone to
help her home.&quot;

In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the
general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying
ordeal of some sort.  When she saw the young gentleman she looked
anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod.  But he followed,
asking with an air of sympathy, &quot;Did you have a bad time?&quot;

&quot;Not very.&quot;

&quot;You got through quickly.&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank goodness!&quot;

&quot;Why did you go alone?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t want anyone to know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the oddest fellow I ever saw.  How many did you have out?&quot;

Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to
laugh as if mightily amused at something.

&quot;There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.&quot;

&quot;What are you laughing at?  You are up to some mischief, Jo,&quot; said
Laurie, looking mystified.

&quot;So are you.  What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?&quot;

&quot;Begging your pardon, ma&#39;am, it wasn&#39;t a billiard saloon, but a
gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of that.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;You can teach me, and then when we play _Hamlet_, you can be Laertes,
and we&#39;ll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.&quot;

Laurie burst out with a hearty boy&#39;s laugh, which made several
passers-by smile in spite of themselves.

&quot;I&#39;ll teach you whether we play _Hamlet_ or not.  It&#39;s grand fun and
will straighten you up capitally.  But I don&#39;t believe that was your
only reason for saying &#39;I&#39;m glad&#39; in that decided way, was it now?&quot;

&quot;No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you
never go to such places.  Do you?&quot;

&quot;Not often.&quot;

&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no harm, Jo.  I have billiards at home, but it&#39;s no fun unless
you have good players, so, as I&#39;m fond of it, I come sometimes and have
a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear, I&#39;m so sorry, for you&#39;ll get to liking it better and better,
and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys.  I
did hope you&#39;d stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,&quot;
said Jo, shaking her head.

&quot;Can&#39;t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without
losing his respectability?&quot; asked Laurie, looking nettled.

&quot;That depends upon how and where he takes it.  I don&#39;t like Ned and his
set, and wish you&#39;d keep out of it.  Mother won&#39;t let us have him at
our house, though he wants to come.  And if you grow like him she won&#39;t
be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.&quot;

&quot;Won&#39;t she?&quot; asked Laurie anxiously.

&quot;No, she can&#39;t bear fashionable young men, and she&#39;d shut us all up in
bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.&quot;

&quot;Well, she needn&#39;t get out her bandboxes yet.  I&#39;m not a fashionable
party and don&#39;t mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then,
don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don&#39;t get wild, will you?
Or there will be an end of all our good times.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be a double distilled saint.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t bear saints.  Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and
we&#39;ll never desert you.  I don&#39;t know what I should do if you acted
like Mr. King&#39;s son.  He had plenty of money, but didn&#39;t know how to
spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his
father&#39;s name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.&quot;

&quot;You think I&#39;m likely to do the same?  Much obliged.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about money
being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I
shouldn&#39;t worry then.&quot;

&quot;Do you worry about me, Jo?&quot;

&quot;A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,
for you&#39;ve got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I&#39;m
afraid it would be hard to stop you.&quot;

Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she
had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips smiled
as if at her warnings.

&quot;Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?&quot; he asked
presently.

&quot;Of course not.  Why?&quot;

&quot;Because if you are, I&#39;ll take a bus.  If you&#39;re not, I&#39;d like to walk
with you and tell you something very interesting.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t preach any more, and I&#39;d like to hear the news immensely.&quot;

&quot;Very well, then, come on.  It&#39;s a secret, and if I tell you, you must
tell me yours.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t got any,&quot; began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that
she had.

&quot;You know you have--you can&#39;t hide anything, so up and &#39;fess, or I
won&#39;t tell,&quot; cried Laurie.

&quot;Is your secret a nice one?&quot;

&quot;Oh, isn&#39;t it!  All about people you know, and such fun!  You ought to
hear it, and I&#39;ve been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you
begin.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll not say anything about it at home, will you?&quot;

&quot;Not a word.&quot;

&quot;And you won&#39;t tease me in private?&quot;

&quot;I never tease.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you do.  You get everything you want out of people.  I don&#39;t know
how you do it, but you are a born wheedler.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.  Fire away.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve left two stories with a newspaperman, and he&#39;s to give his
answer next week,&quot; whispered Jo, in her confidant&#39;s ear.

&quot;Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!&quot; cried
Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight
of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
for they were out of the city now.

&quot;Hush!  It won&#39;t come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn&#39;t rest till
I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn&#39;t want anyone
else to be disappointed.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t fail.  Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare
compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won&#39;t it be
fun to see them in print, and shan&#39;t we feel proud of our authoress?&quot;

Jo&#39;s eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a
friend&#39;s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.

&quot;Where&#39;s your secret?  Play fair, Teddy, or I&#39;ll never believe you
again,&quot; she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed
up at a word of encouragement.

&quot;I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn&#39;t promise not to, so I
will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I&#39;ve told you any plummy
bit of news I get.  I know where Meg&#39;s glove is.&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot; said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and
twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.

&quot;It&#39;s quite enough for the present, as you&#39;ll agree when I tell you
where it is.&quot;

&quot;Tell, then.&quot;

Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo&#39;s ear, which produced a
comical change.  She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both
surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, &quot;How do you
know?&quot;

&quot;Saw it.&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot;

&quot;Pocket.&quot;

&quot;All this time?&quot;

&quot;Yes, isn&#39;t that romantic?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s horrid.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you like it?&quot;

&quot;Of course I don&#39;t.  It&#39;s ridiculous, it won&#39;t be allowed.  My
patience!  What would Meg say?&quot;

&quot;You are not to tell anyone.  Mind that.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t promise.&quot;

&quot;That was understood, and I trusted you.&quot;

&quot;Well, I won&#39;t for the present, anyway, but I&#39;m disgusted, and wish you
hadn&#39;t told me.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d be pleased.&quot;

&quot;At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to see anyone try it,&quot; cried Jo fiercely.

&quot;So should I!&quot; and Laurie chuckled at the idea.

&quot;I don&#39;t think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind
since you told me that,&quot; said Jo rather ungratefully.

&quot;Race down this hill with me, and you&#39;ll be all right,&quot; suggested
Laurie.

No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and
finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat
and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached
the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his
treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright
eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.

&quot;I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,
and not lose my breath.  It was capital, but see what a guy it&#39;s made
me.  Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,&quot; said Jo,
dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with
crimson leaves.

Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled
up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.
But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking
particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been
making calls.

&quot;What in the world are you doing here?&quot; she asked, regarding her
disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.

&quot;Getting leaves,&quot; meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had
just swept up.

&quot;And hairpins,&quot; added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo&#39;s lap.
&quot;They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.&quot;

&quot;You have been running, Jo.  How could you?  When will you stop such
romping ways?&quot; said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and
smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.

&quot;Never till I&#39;m stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don&#39;t try to
make me grow up before my time, Meg.  It&#39;s hard enough to have you
change all of a sudden.  Let me be a little girl as long as I can.&quot;

As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her
lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a
woman, and Laurie&#39;s secret made her dread the separation which must
surely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in
her face and drew Meg&#39;s attention from it by asking quickly, &quot;Where
have you been calling, all so fine?&quot;

&quot;At the Gardiners&#39;, and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle
Moffat&#39;s wedding.  It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend
the winter in Paris.  Just think how delightful that must be!&quot;

&quot;Do you envy her, Meg?&quot; said Laurie.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I do.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of it!&quot; muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.

&quot;Why?&quot; asked Meg, looking surprised.

&quot;Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a
poor man,&quot; said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to
mind what she said.

&quot;I shall never &#39;_go_ and marry&#39; anyone,&quot; observed Meg, walking on with
great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping
stones, and &#39;behaving like children&#39;, as Meg said to herself, though
she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best
dress on.

For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite
bewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to
Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a
woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in
a very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to
one another, and talking about &#39;Spread Eagles&#39; till the girls declared
they had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out
of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by
the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally
capturing her in Amy&#39;s bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,
but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices
and a great flapping of newspapers.

&quot;What shall we do with that girl?  She never _will_ behave like a young
lady,&quot; sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.

&quot;I hope she won&#39;t.  She is so funny and dear as she is,&quot; said Beth, who
had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo&#39;s having secrets
with anyone but her.

&quot;It&#39;s very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,&quot; added Amy,
who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a
very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually
elegant and ladylike.

In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected
to read.

&quot;Have you anything interesting there?&quot; asked Meg, with condescension.

&quot;Nothing but a story, won&#39;t amount to much, I guess,&quot; returned Jo,
carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.

&quot;You&#39;d better read it aloud.  That will amuse us and keep you out of
mischief,&quot; said Amy in her most grown-up tone.

&quot;What&#39;s the name?&quot; asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind
the sheet.

&quot;The Rival Painters.&quot;

&quot;That sounds well.  Read it,&quot; said Meg.

With a loud &quot;Hem!&quot; and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The
girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat
pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. &quot;I like that about
the splendid picture,&quot; was Amy&#39;s approving remark, as Jo paused.

&quot;I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite
names, isn&#39;t that queer?&quot; said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering
part was tragical.

&quot;Who wrote it?&quot; asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo&#39;s face.

The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed
countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement
replied in a loud voice, &quot;Your sister.&quot;

&quot;You?&quot; cried Meg, dropping her work.

&quot;It&#39;s very good,&quot; said Amy critically.

&quot;I knew it!  I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!&quot;  and Beth ran to hug
her sister and exult over this splendid success.

Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!  How Meg wouldn&#39;t
believe it till she saw the words.  &quot;Miss Josephine March,&quot; actually
printed in the paper.  How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts
of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately
couldn&#39;t be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth
got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to
exclaim, &quot;Sakes alive, well I never!&quot; in great astonishment at &#39;that
Jo&#39;s doin&#39;s&#39;.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo
laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a
peacock and done with it, and how the &#39;Spread Eagle&#39; might be said to
flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper
passed from hand to hand.

&quot;Tell us about it.&quot;  &quot;When did it come?&quot; &quot;How much did you get for it?&quot;
&quot;What will Father say?&quot; &quot;Won&#39;t Laurie laugh?&quot; cried the family, all in
one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate
people made a jubilee of every little household joy.

&quot;Stop jabbering, girls, and I&#39;ll tell you everything,&quot; said Jo,
wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did
over her &#39;Rival Painters&#39;.  Having told how she disposed of her tales,
Jo added, &quot;And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them
both, but didn&#39;t pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and
noticed the stories.  It was good practice, he said, and when the
beginners improved, anyone would pay.  So I let him have the two
stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it
and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.  And he said it was good, and
I shall write more, and he&#39;s going to get the next paid for, and I am
so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the
girls.&quot;

Jo&#39;s breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she
bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be
independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest
wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that
happy end.



CHAPTER FIFTEEN

A TELEGRAM

&quot;November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,&quot; said
Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the
frostbitten garden.

&quot;That&#39;s the reason I was born in it,&quot; observed Jo pensively, quite
unconscious of the blot on her nose.

&quot;If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a
delightful month,&quot; said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything,
even November.

&quot;I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,&quot;
said Meg, who was out of sorts.  &quot;We go grubbing along day after day,
without a bit of change, and very little fun.  We might as well be in a
treadmill.&quot;

&quot;My patience, how blue we are!&quot; cried Jo.  &quot;I don&#39;t much wonder, poor
dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind,
grind, year in and year out.  Oh, don&#39;t I wish I could manage things
for you as I do for my heroines!  You&#39;re pretty enough and good enough
already, so I&#39;d have some rich relation leave you a fortune
unexpectedly.  Then you&#39;d dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who
has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze
of splendor and elegance.&quot;

&quot;People don&#39;t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have
to work and women marry for money.  It&#39;s a dreadfully unjust world,&quot;
said Meg bitterly.

&quot;Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.  Just wait ten years,
and see if we don&#39;t,&quot; said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as
Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.

&quot;Can&#39;t wait, and I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t much faith in ink and dirt,
though I&#39;m grateful for your good intentions.&quot;

Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.  Jo groaned and
leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy
spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,
said, smiling, &quot;Two pleasant things are going to happen right away.
Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the
garden as if he had something nice to tell.&quot;

In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, &quot;Any letter from
Father, girls?&quot; and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, &quot;Won&#39;t some of
you come for a drive?  I&#39;ve been working away at mathematics till my
head is in a muddle, and I&#39;m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.
It&#39;s a dull day, but the air isn&#39;t bad, and I&#39;m going to take Brooke
home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn&#39;t out.  Come, Jo, you and
Beth will go, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Of course we will.&quot;

&quot;Much obliged, but I&#39;m busy.&quot;  And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for
she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not
to drive too often with the young gentleman.

&quot;We three will be ready in a minute,&quot; cried Amy, running away to wash
her hands.

&quot;Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?&quot; asked Laurie, leaning over
Mrs. March&#39;s chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave
her.

&quot;No, thank you, except call at the office, if you&#39;ll be so kind, dear.
It&#39;s our day for a letter, and the postman hasn&#39;t been.  Father is as
regular as the sun, but there&#39;s some delay on the way, perhaps.&quot;

A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a
letter.

&quot;It&#39;s one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,&quot; she said, handling it
as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.

At the word &#39;telegraph&#39;, Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it
contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little
paper had sent a bullet to her heart.  Laurie dashed downstairs for
water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a
frightened voice...

    Mrs. March:
    Your husband is very ill.  Come at once.
    S.  HALE
    Blank Hospital, Washington.

How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the
day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to
change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the
happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.

Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and
stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never
forgot, &quot;I shall go at once, but it may be too late.  Oh, children,
children, help me to bear it!&quot;

For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the
room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,
and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.  Poor Hannah was the
first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a
good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.

&quot;The Lord keep the dear man!  I won&#39;t waste no time a-cryin&#39;, but git
your things ready right away, mum,&quot; she said heartily, as she wiped her
face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her
own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.

&quot;She&#39;s right, there&#39;s no time for tears now.  Be calm, girls, and let
me think.&quot;

They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking
pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.

&quot;Where&#39;s Laurie?&quot; she asked presently, when she had collected her
thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.

&quot;Here, ma&#39;am.  Oh, let me do something!&quot; cried the boy, hurrying from
the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow
was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.

&quot;Send a telegram saying I will come at once.  The next train goes early
in the morning.  I&#39;ll take that.&quot;

&quot;What else?  The horses are ready.  I can go anywhere, do anything,&quot; he
said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.

&quot;Leave a note at Aunt March&#39;s.  Jo, give me that pen and paper.&quot;

Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew
the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad
journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to
add a little to the sum for her father.

&quot;Now go, dear, but don&#39;t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace.
There is no need of that.&quot;

Mrs. March&#39;s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later
Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his
life.

&quot;Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can&#39;t come. On the way
get these things.  I&#39;ll put them down, they&#39;ll be needed and I must go
prepared for nursing.  Hospital stores are not always good.  Beth, go
and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.  I&#39;m not too
proud to beg for Father.  He shall have the best of everything.  Amy,
tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find
my things, for I&#39;m half bewildered.&quot;

Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the
poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little
while, and let them work.  Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust
of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if
the paper had been an evil spell.

Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the
kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest
promises of protection for the girls during the mother&#39;s absence, which
comforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn&#39;t offer, from his
own dressing gown to himself as escort.  But the last was impossible.
Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman&#39;s undertaking the long
journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,
for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy
eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he&#39;d be
back directly.  No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran
through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea
in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,&quot; he said, in the kind,
quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.  &quot;I
came to offer myself as escort to your mother.  Mr. Laurence has
commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction
to be of service to her there.&quot;

Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg
put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke
would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling
one of time and comfort which he was about to take.

&quot;How kind you all are!  Mother will accept, I&#39;m sure, and it will be
such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.  Thank
you very, very much!&quot;

Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the
brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and
lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.

Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from
Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what
she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd
for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come
of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.
March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on
with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo
would have understood if she had been there.

The short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg
and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy
got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a &#39;slap
and a bang&#39;, but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and
Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take
into her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a
very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun
and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as
much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a
little choke in her voice, &quot;That&#39;s my contribution toward making Father
comfortable and bringing him home!&quot;

&quot;My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you
haven&#39;t done anything rash?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s mine honestly.  I didn&#39;t beg, borrow, or steal it.  I earned
it, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.&quot;

As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for
all her abundant hair was cut short.

&quot;Your hair!  Your beautiful hair!&quot;  &quot;Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one
beauty.&quot;  &quot;My dear girl, there was no need of this.&quot;  &quot;She doesn&#39;t look
like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!&quot;

As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo
assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,
and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked
it, &quot;It doesn&#39;t affect the fate of the nation, so don&#39;t wail, Beth.  It
will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will
do my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels
deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a
curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.
I&#39;m satisfied, so please take the money and let&#39;s have supper.&quot;

&quot;Tell me all about it, Jo.  I am not quite satisfied, but I can&#39;t blame
you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call
it, to your love.  But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I&#39;m afraid
you will regret it one of these days,&quot; said Mrs. March.

&quot;No, I won&#39;t!&quot; returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her
prank was not entirely condemned.

&quot;What made you do it?&quot; asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of
cutting off her head as her pretty hair.

&quot;Well, I was wild to do something for Father,&quot; replied Jo, as they
gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the
midst of trouble.  &quot;I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew
Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.
Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some
clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,
if I sold the nose off my face to get it.&quot;

&quot;You needn&#39;t feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got
the simplest with your own hard earnings,&quot; said Mrs. March with a look
that warmed Jo&#39;s heart.

&quot;I hadn&#39;t the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went
along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I&#39;d like to
dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber&#39;s
window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,
not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden
that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to
think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give
for mine.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see how you dared to do it,&quot; said Beth in a tone of awe.

&quot;Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his
hair.  He rather stared at first, as if he wasn&#39;t used to having girls
bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.  He said he didn&#39;t
care about mine, it wasn&#39;t the fashionable color, and he never paid
much for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and
so on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn&#39;t done right
away that I shouldn&#39;t have it done at all, and you know when I start to
do a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told
him why I was in such a hurry.  It was silly, I dare say, but it
changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my
topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, &#39;Take it,
Thomas, and oblige the young lady.  I&#39;d do as much for our Jimmy any
day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.&quot;

&quot;Who was Jimmy?&quot; asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they
went along.

&quot;Her son, she said, who was in the army.  How friendly such things make
strangers feel, don&#39;t they?  She talked away all the time the man
clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?&quot; asked Meg, with a
shiver.

&quot;I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that
was the end of it.  I never snivel over trifles like that. I will
confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on
the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost
seemed as if I&#39;d an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and
picked out a long lock for me to keep.  I&#39;ll give it to you, Marmee,
just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don&#39;t
think I shall ever have a mane again.&quot;

Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short
gray one in her desk.  She only said, &quot;Thank you, deary,&quot; but something
in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully
as they could about Mr. Brooke&#39;s kindness, the prospect of a fine day
tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to
be nursed.

No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o&#39;clock Mrs. March put by the
last finished job, and said, &quot;Come girls.&quot;  Beth went to the piano and
played the father&#39;s favorite hymn.  All began bravely, but broke down
one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to
her music was always a sweet consoler.

&quot;Go to bed and don&#39;t talk, for we must be up early and shall need all
the sleep we can get.  Good night, my darlings,&quot; said Mrs. March, as
the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.

They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear
invalid lay in the next room.  Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite
of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious
thoughts she had ever known in her short life.  Jo lay motionless, and
her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her
exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...

&quot;Jo, dear, what is it?  Are you crying about father?&quot;

&quot;No, not now.&quot;

&quot;What then?&quot;

&quot;My... My hair!&quot; burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her
emotion in the pillow.

It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the
afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.

&quot;I&#39;m not sorry,&quot; protested Jo, with a choke.  &quot;I&#39;d do it again
tomorrow, if I could.  It&#39;s only the vain part of me that goes and
cries in this silly way.  Don&#39;t tell anyone, it&#39;s all over now.  I
thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my
one beauty.  How came you to be awake?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t sleep, I&#39;m so anxious,&quot; said Meg.

&quot;Think about something pleasant, and you&#39;ll soon drop off.&quot;

&quot;I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.&quot;

&quot;What did you think of?&quot;

&quot;Handsome faces--eyes particularly,&quot; answered Meg, smiling to herself
in the dark.

&quot;What color do you like best?&quot;

&quot;Brown, that is, sometimes.  Blue are lovely.&quot;

Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably
promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in
her castle in the air.

The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a
figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,
settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each
unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to
pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.  As she lifted the
curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from
behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,
which seemed to whisper in the silence, &quot;Be comforted, dear soul!
There is always light behind the clouds.&quot;



CHAPTER SIXTEEN

LETTERS

In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter
with an earnestness never felt before.  For now the shadow of a real
trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and
as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,
and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or
complaints from them.  Everything seemed very strange when they went
down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.
Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah&#39;s familiar
face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap
on.  The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother&#39;s cloak and bonnet
lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so
pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it
very hard to keep their resolution.  Meg&#39;s eyes kept filling in spite
of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more
than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as
if sorrow was a new experience to them.

Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting
for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied
about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of
her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up
her travelling bag...

&quot;Children, I leave you to Hannah&#39;s care and Mr. Laurence&#39;s protection.
Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as
if you were his own.  I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that
you should take this trouble rightly.  Don&#39;t grieve and fret when I am
gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being
idle and trying to forget.  Go on with your work as usual, for work is
a blessed solace.  Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember
that you never can be fatherless.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mother.&quot;

&quot;Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in
any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence.  Be patient, Jo, don&#39;t get
despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl,
ready to help and cheer all.  Beth, comfort yourself with your music,
and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you
can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.&quot;

&quot;We will, Mother!  We will!&quot;

The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.
That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well.  No one cried,
no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very
heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they
spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their
mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands
cheerfully when she drove away.

Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke
looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him
&#39;Mr. Greatheart&#39; on the spot.

&quot;Good-by, my darlings!  God bless and keep us all!&quot; whispered Mrs.
March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried
into the carriage.

As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it
shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.  They saw it also,
and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she
turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a
bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.

&quot;How kind everyone is to us!&quot; she said, turning to find fresh proof of
it in the respectful sympathy of the young man&#39;s face.

&quot;I don&#39;t see how they can help it,&quot; returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so
infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey
began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.

&quot;I feel as if there had been an earthquake,&quot; said Jo, as their
neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh
themselves.

&quot;It seems as if half the house was gone,&quot; added Meg forlornly.

Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile
of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother&#39;s table, showing that even in
her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them.  It was a
little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of
their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.

Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the
shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with
a coffeepot.

&quot;Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don&#39;t fret.
Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let&#39;s fall to work
and be a credit to the family.&quot;

Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that
morning.  No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant
invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot.  They drew up to
the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten
minutes were all right again.

&quot;&#39;Hope and keep busy&#39;, that&#39;s the motto for us, so let&#39;s see who will
remember it best.  I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won&#39;t she
lecture though!&quot; said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.

&quot;I shall go to my Kings, though I&#39;d much rather stay at home and attend
to things here,&quot; said Meg, wishing she hadn&#39;t made her eyes so red.

&quot;No need of that.  Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,&quot; put in
Amy, with an important air.

&quot;Hannah will tell us what to do, and we&#39;ll have everything nice when
you come home,&quot; added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without
delay.

&quot;I think anxiety is very interesting,&quot; observed Amy, eating sugar
pensively.

The girls couldn&#39;t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg
shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar
bowl.

The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went
out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window
where they were accustomed to see their mother&#39;s face.  It was gone,
but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she
was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.

&quot;That&#39;s so like my Beth!&quot; said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful
face.  &quot;Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won&#39;t strain today.  Don&#39;t
fret about Father, dear,&quot; she added, as they parted.

&quot;And I hope Aunt March won&#39;t croak.  Your hair is becoming, and it
looks very boyish and nice,&quot; returned Meg, trying not to smile at the
curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;That&#39;s my only comfort.&quot; And, touching her hat a la Laurie, away went
Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.

News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though
dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had
already done him good.  Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as
the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which
grew more cheerful as the week passed.  At first, everyone was eager to
write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by
one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their
Washington correspondence.  As one of these packets contained
characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and
read them.

My dearest Mother:

It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for
the news was so good we couldn&#39;t help laughing and crying over it.  How
very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence&#39;s business
detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father.
The girls are all as good as gold.  Jo helps me with the sewing, and
insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs.  I should be afraid she might
overdo, if I didn&#39;t know her &#39;moral fit&#39; wouldn&#39;t last long.  Beth is
as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told
her.  She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at
her little piano.  Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her.
She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and
mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased
with her improvement when you come.  Mr. Laurence watches over us like
a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.
He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel
like orphans, with you so far away.  Hannah is a perfect saint.  She
does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is
quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect.  We are all well
and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back.  Give my
dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...

MEG

This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to
the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,
ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed
letters.

My precious Marmee:

Three cheers for dear Father!  Brooke was a trump to telegraph right
off, and let us know the minute he was better.  I rushed up garret when
the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I
could only cry, and say, &quot;I&#39;m glad!  I&#39;m glad!&quot; Didn&#39;t that do as well
as a regular prayer?  For I felt a great many in my heart.  We have
such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so
desperately good, it&#39;s like living in a nest of turtledoves.  You&#39;d
laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish.  She gets
prettier every day, and I&#39;m in love with her sometimes.  The children
are regular archangels, and I--well, I&#39;m Jo, and never shall be
anything else.  Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel
with Laurie.  I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was
offended.  I was right, but didn&#39;t speak as I ought, and he marched
home, saying he wouldn&#39;t come again till I begged pardon.  I declared I
wouldn&#39;t and got mad. It lasted all day.  I felt bad and wanted you
very much.  Laurie and I are both so proud, it&#39;s hard to beg pardon.
But I thought he&#39;d come to it, for I was in the right.  He didn&#39;t come,
and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the
river.  I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun
set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry.  I met him at
the gate, coming for the same thing.  We both laughed, begged each
other&#39;s pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.

I made a &#39;pome&#39; yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as
Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him.  Give
him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for
your...

TOPSY-TURVY JO


    A SONG FROM THE SUDS

    Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,
    While the white foam rises high,
    And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,
    And fasten the clothes to dry.
    Then out in the free fresh air they swing,
    Under the sunny sky.

    I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls
    The stains of the week away,
    And let water and air by their magic make
    Ourselves as pure as they.
    Then on the earth there would be indeed,
    A glorious washing day!

    Along the path of a useful life,
    Will heart&#39;s-ease ever bloom.
    The busy mind has no time to think
    Of sorrow or care or gloom.
    And anxious thoughts may be swept away,
    As we bravely wield a broom.

    I am glad a task to me is given,
    To labor at day by day,
    For it brings me health and strength and hope,
    And I cheerfully learn to say,
    &quot;Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,
    But, Hand, you shall work alway!&quot;


Dear Mother,

There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies
from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see.
I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep
with Father&#39;s tune.  I can&#39;t sing &#39;LAND OF THE LEAL&#39; now, it makes me
cry.  Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without
you.  Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop.  I didn&#39;t forget
to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.

Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine.  Oh, do come soon to your
loving...

LITTLE BETH


Ma Chere Mamma,

We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the
girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you can
take the properest.  Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have
jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me
sweet tempered.  Laurie is not as respeckful as he ought to be now I am
almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking
French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King
does.  The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in
new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the
dress.  I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do
wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats
every day.  Can&#39;t she?  Didn&#39;t I make that interrigation point nice?
Meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am
mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I can&#39;t stop.
Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa.  Your affectionate daughter...

AMY CURTIS MARCH


Dear Mis March,

I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate.  The girls is clever and
fly round right smart.  Miss Meg is going to make a proper good
housekeeper.  She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things
surprisin quick.  Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don&#39;t stop
to cal&#39;k&#39;late fust, and you never know where she&#39;s like to bring up.
She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched &#39;em afore
they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I
should a died a laughin.  Beth is the best of little creeters, and a
sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable.  She tries to
learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, likewise
keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful.  We have got on very
economical so fur.  I don&#39;t let the girls hev coffee only once a week,
accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles.  Amy
does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet
stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house
upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full
swing.  The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin,
but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin.  My bread is riz, so
no more at this time.  I send my duty to Mr. March, and hope he&#39;s seen
the last of his Pewmonia.

Yours respectful,

Hannah Mullet

Dear Madam:

The little girls are all well.  Beth and my boy report daily. Hannah is

Thank God he is mending.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

LITTLE FAITHFUL

For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied
the neighborhood.  It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a
heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion.  Relieved
of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed
their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old
ways.  They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy
seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt
that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.

Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough,
and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March
didn&#39;t like to hear people read with colds in their heads.  Jo liked
this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on
the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books.  Amy found that
housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud
pies.  Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at
home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or
reading the Washington dispatches over and over.  Beth kept on, with
only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.

All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her
sisters&#39; also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a
clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.  When her heart got heavy
with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a
certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made
her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself.
Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt
how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for
comfort or advice in their small affairs.

All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and
when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and
deserved praise.  So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do
well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.

&quot;Meg, I wish you&#39;d go and see the Hummels.  You know Mother told us not
to forget them.&quot; said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March&#39;s departure.

&quot;I&#39;m too tired to go this afternoon,&quot; replied Meg, rocking comfortably
as she sewed.

&quot;Can&#39;t you, Jo?&quot; asked Beth.

&quot;Too stormy for me with my cold.&quot;

&quot;I thought it was almost well.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to
go to the Hummels&#39;,&quot; said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of
her inconsistency.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go yourself?&quot; asked Meg.

&quot;I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don&#39;t know what to
do for it.  Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of
it.  But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to
go.&quot;

Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.

&quot;Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air
will do you good,&quot; said Jo, adding apologetically, &quot;I&#39;d go but I want
to finish my writing.&quot;

&quot;My head aches and I&#39;m tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,&quot;
said Beth.

&quot;Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,&quot; suggested Meg.

So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and
the Hummels were forgotten.  An hour passed.  Amy did not come, Meg
went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story,
and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly
put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor
children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a
grieved look in her patient eyes.  It was late when she came back, and
no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother&#39;s room.
Half an hour after, Jo went to &#39;Mother&#39;s closet&#39; for something, and
there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very
grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.

&quot;Christopher Columbus!  What&#39;s the matter?&quot; cried Jo, as Beth put out
her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .

&quot;You&#39;ve had the scarlet fever, haven&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Years ago, when Meg did.  Why?&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll tell you.  Oh, Jo, the baby&#39;s dead!&quot;

&quot;What baby?&quot;

&quot;Mrs. Hummel&#39;s.  It died in my lap before she got home,&quot; cried Beth
with a sob.

&quot;My poor dear, how dreadful for you!  I ought to have gone,&quot; said Jo,
taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother&#39;s big
chair, with a remorseful face.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t dreadful, Jo, only so sad!  I saw in a minute it was sicker,
but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and
let Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little
cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,
and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn&#39;t stir, and I knew it was
dead.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t cry, dear!  What did you do?&quot;

&quot;I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor.
He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore
throats.  &#39;Scarlet fever, ma&#39;am.  Ought to have called me before,&#39; he
said crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure
baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to
help the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and
was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned
round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right
away, or I&#39;d have the fever.&quot;

&quot;No, you won&#39;t!&quot; cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look.
&quot;Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What
shall we do?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be frightened, I guess I shan&#39;t have it badly.  I looked in
Mother&#39;s book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and
queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel
better,&quot; said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and
trying to look well.

&quot;If Mother was only at home!&quot; exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and
feeling that Washington was an immense way off.  She read a page,
looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said
gravely, &quot;You&#39;ve been over the baby every day for more than a week, and
among the others who are going to have it, so I&#39;m afraid you are going
to have it, Beth.  I&#39;ll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let Amy come.  She never had it, and I should hate to give it to
her.  Can&#39;t you and Meg have it over again?&quot; asked Beth, anxiously.

&quot;I guess not.  Don&#39;t care if I do.  Serve me right, selfish pig, to let
you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!&quot; muttered Jo, as she went to
consult Hannah.

The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,
assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,
and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt
much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

&quot;Now I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;ll do,&quot; said Hannah, when she had examined
and questioned Beth, &quot;we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at
you, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we&#39;ll send Amy off to
Aunt March&#39;s for a spell, to keep her out of harm&#39;s way, and one of you
girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.&quot;

&quot;I shall stay, of course, I&#39;m oldest,&quot; began Meg, looking anxious and
self-reproachful.

&quot;I shall, because it&#39;s my fault she is sick.  I told Mother I&#39;d do the
errands, and I haven&#39;t,&quot; said Jo decidedly.

&quot;Which will you have, Beth?  There ain&#39;t no need of but one,&quot; aid
Hannah.

&quot;Jo, please.&quot; And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a
contented look, which effectually settled that point.

&quot;I&#39;ll go and tell Amy,&quot; said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather
relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.

Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather
have the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and
commanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg
left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came
back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head
in the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,
but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,
whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he
sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, &quot;Now be a
sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don&#39;t cry, but hear what
a jolly plan I&#39;ve got.  You go to Aunt March&#39;s, and I&#39;ll come and take
you out every day, driving or walking, and we&#39;ll have capital times.
Won&#39;t that be better than moping here?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,&quot; began Amy, in an
injured voice.

&quot;Bless your heart, child, it&#39;s to keep you well.  You don&#39;t want to be
sick, do you?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t, but I dare say I shall be, for I&#39;ve been with
Beth all the time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may
escape it.  Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or
if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly.  I
advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke,
miss.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s dull at Aunt March&#39;s, and she is so cross,&quot; said Amy, looking
rather frightened.

&quot;It won&#39;t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,
and take you out gallivanting.  The old lady likes me, and I&#39;ll be as
sweet as possible to her, so she won&#39;t peck at us, whatever we do.&quot;

&quot;Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?&quot;

&quot;On my honor as a gentleman.&quot;

&quot;And come every single day?&quot;

&quot;See if I don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;And bring me back the minute Beth is well?&quot;

&quot;The identical minute.&quot;

&quot;And go to the theater, truly?&quot;

&quot;A dozen theaters, if we may.&quot;

&quot;Well--I guess I will,&quot; said Amy slowly.

&quot;Good girl!  Call Meg, and tell her you&#39;ll give in,&quot; said Laurie, with
an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the &#39;giving in&#39;.

Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been
wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised
to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

&quot;How is the little dear?&quot; asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet,
and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.

&quot;She is lying down on Mother&#39;s bed, and feels better.  The baby&#39;s death
troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she
thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,&quot; answered
Meg.

&quot;What a trying world it is!&quot; said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful
way.  &quot;No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another.
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother&#39;s gone, so
I&#39;m all at sea.&quot;

&quot;Well, don&#39;t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn&#39;t becoming. Settle
your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do
anything?&quot; asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of
his friend&#39;s one beauty.

&quot;That is what troubles me,&quot; said Meg.  &quot;I think we ought to tell her if
Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn&#39;t, for Mother can&#39;t leave
Father, and it will only make them anxious.  Beth won&#39;t be sick long,
and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,
so I suppose we must, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite right to me.&quot;

&quot;Hum, well, I can&#39;t say.  Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor
has been.&quot;

&quot;We will.  Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,&quot; commanded Meg. &quot;We can&#39;t
decide anything till he has been.&quot;

&quot;Stay where you are, Jo.  I&#39;m errand boy to this establishment,&quot; said
Laurie, taking up his cap.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid you are busy,&quot; began Meg.

&quot;No, I&#39;ve done my lessons for the day.&quot;

&quot;Do you study in vacation time?&quot; asked Jo.

&quot;I follow the good example my neighbors set me,&quot; was Laurie&#39;s answer,
as he swung himself out of the room.

&quot;I have great hopes for my boy,&quot; observed Jo, watching him fly over the
fence with an approving smile.

&quot;He does very well, for a boy,&quot; was Meg&#39;s somewhat ungracious answer,
for the subject did not interest her.

Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she
would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.
Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off
danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.

Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.

&quot;What do you want now?&quot; she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,
while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...

&quot;Go away.  No boys allowed here.&quot;

Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.

&quot;No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among
poor folks.  Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn&#39;t sick,
which I&#39;ve no doubt she will be, looks like it now.  Don&#39;t cry, child,
it worries me to hear people sniff.&quot;

Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot&#39;s
tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,
&quot;Bless my boots!&quot; in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.

&quot;What do you hear from your mother?&quot; asked the old lady gruffly.

&quot;Father is much better,&quot; replied Jo, trying to keep sober.

&quot;Oh, is he?  Well, that won&#39;t last long, I fancy.  March never had any
stamina,&quot; was the cheerful reply.

&quot;Ha, ha!  Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!&quot;
squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady&#39;s cap
as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.

&quot;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!  And, Jo, you&#39;d better
go at once.  It isn&#39;t proper to be gadding about so late with a
rattlepated boy like...&quot;

&quot;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!&quot; cried Polly, tumbling
off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the &#39;rattlepated&#39; boy,
who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can bear it, but I&#39;ll try,&quot; thought Amy, as she was
left alone with Aunt March.

&quot;Get along, you fright!&quot; screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy
could not restrain a sniff.



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

DARK DAYS

Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and
the doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.
Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own
way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the
excellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,
and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote
letters in which no mention was made of Beth&#39;s illness.  She could not
think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind
Hannah, and Hannah wouldn&#39;t hear of &#39;Mrs. March bein&#39; told, and worried
just for sech a trifle.&#39;

Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was
very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could
control herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she
began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if
on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen
that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar
faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called
imploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be
allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she &#39;would think of
it, though there was no danger yet&#39;.  A letter from Washington added to
their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of
coming home for a long while.

How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how
heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while
the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that
Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how
rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could
buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of
life.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that
suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice
sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of
Beth&#39;s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all
hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth&#39;s unselfish ambition to
live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple
virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more
than talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly
to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no
service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful
grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.
Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked
the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young
neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone
missed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she
did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to
get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and
good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find
how many friends shy little Beth had made.

Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in
her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for
her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,
and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent
loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write
soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that
Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these
intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing
to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy
sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,
Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to
send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth&#39;s side.

The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter
wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its
death.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held
the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,
saying, in a low voice to Hannah, &quot;If Mrs. March can leave her husband
she&#39;d better be sent for.&quot;

Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg
dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs
at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a
minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on
her things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while
noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying
that Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy
weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of
misery that Laurie asked quickly, &quot;What is it?  Is Beth worse?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve sent for Mother,&quot; said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a
tragic expression.

&quot;Good for you, Jo!  Did you do it on your own responsibility?&quot; asked
Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious
boots, seeing how her hands shook.

&quot;No.  The doctor told us to.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Jo, it&#39;s not so bad as that?&quot; cried Laurie, with a startled face.

&quot;Yes, it is.  She doesn&#39;t know us, she doesn&#39;t even talk about the
flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She
doesn&#39;t look like my Beth, and there&#39;s nobody to help us bear it.
Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can&#39;t find
Him.&quot;

As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo&#39;s cheeks, she stretched out her
hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie
took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his
throat, &quot;I&#39;m here.  Hold on to me, Jo, dear!&quot;

She could not speak, but she did &#39;hold on&#39;, and the warm grasp of the
friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her
nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.

Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting
words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as
her mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far
more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken
sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection
administers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved
her, and looked up with a grateful face.

&quot;Thank you, Teddy, I&#39;m better now.  I don&#39;t feel so forlorn, and will
try to bear it if it comes.&quot;

&quot;Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother
will be here, and then everything will be all right.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad Father is better.  Now she won&#39;t feel so bad about leaving
him.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and
I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,&quot; sighed Jo, spreading her wet
handkerchief over her knees to dry.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t Meg pull fair?&quot; asked Laurie, looking indignant.

&quot;Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can&#39;t love Bethy as I do, and she won&#39;t
miss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can&#39;t give her up.
I can&#39;t!  I can&#39;t!&quot;

Down went Jo&#39;s face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried
despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a
tear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till
he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.
It might be unmanly, but he couldn&#39;t help it, and I am glad of it.
Presently, as Jo&#39;s sobs quieted, he said hopefully, &quot;I don&#39;t think she
will die.  She&#39;s so good, and we all love her so much, I don&#39;t believe
God will take her away yet.&quot;

&quot;The good and dear people always do die,&quot; groaned Jo, but she stopped
crying, for her friend&#39;s words cheered her up in spite of her own
doubts and fears.

&quot;Poor girl, you&#39;re worn out.  It isn&#39;t like you to be forlorn. Stop a
bit.  I&#39;ll hearten you up in a jiffy.&quot;

Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down
on Beth&#39;s little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from
the table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for
the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and
when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a
smile, and said bravely, &quot;I drink-- Health to my Beth!  You are a good
doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?&quot;
she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done
her troubled mind.

&quot;I&#39;ll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I&#39;ll give you something that
will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,&quot; said
Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at
something.

&quot;What is it?&quot; cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.

&quot;I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she&#39;d come
at once, and she&#39;ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.
Aren&#39;t you glad I did it?&quot;

Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for
he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or
harming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the
moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms
round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, &quot;Oh, Laurie!  Oh,
Mother!  I am so glad!&quot;  She did not weep again, but laughed
hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a
little bewildered by the sudden news.

Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.
He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,
followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at
once.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying
breathlessly, &quot;Oh, don&#39;t!  I didn&#39;t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but
you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn&#39;t
help flying at you.  Tell me all about it, and don&#39;t give me wine
again, it makes me act so.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.  &quot;Why, you see I
got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.  We thought Hannah was overdoing the
authority business, and your mother ought to know. She&#39;d never forgive
us if Beth...  Well, if anything happened, you know.  So I got grandpa
to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the
office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my
head off when I proposed a telegram.  I never can bear to be &#39;lorded
over&#39;, so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I
know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and
you&#39;ve only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till
that blessed lady gets here.&quot;

&quot;Laurie, you&#39;re an angel!  How shall I ever thank you?&quot;

&quot;Fly at me again.  I rather liked it,&quot; said Laurie, looking
mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.

&quot;No, thank you.  I&#39;ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don&#39;t
tease, but go home and rest, for you&#39;ll be up half the night. Bless
you, Teddy, bless you!&quot;

Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she
vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a
dresser and told the assembled cats that she was &quot;happy, oh, so happy!&quot;
while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of
it.

&quot;That&#39;s the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do
hope Mrs. March is coming right away,&quot; said Hannah, with an air of
relief, when Jo told the good news.

Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set
the sickroom in order, and Hannah &quot;knocked up a couple of pies in case
of company unexpected&quot;.  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through
the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet
rooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth&#39;s bird
began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy&#39;s
bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,
and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as
they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, &quot;Mother&#39;s coming,
dear! Mother&#39;s coming!&quot;  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that
heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It
was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once
busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and
the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the
pillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,
&quot;Water!&quot; with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All
day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and
trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind
raged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and
every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side
of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour
brought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,
for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which
time he would return.

Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed&#39;s foot and fell
fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling
that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March&#39;s countenance
as she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring
into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes
beautifully soft and clear.

The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they
kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes
to us in hours like those.

&quot;If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,&quot; whispered Meg
earnestly.

&quot;If god spares Beth, I&#39;ll try to love and serve Him all my life,&quot;
answered Jo, with equal fervor.

&quot;I wish I had no heart, it aches so,&quot; sighed Meg, after a pause.

&quot;If life is often as hard as this, I don&#39;t see how we ever shall get
through it,&quot; added her sister despondently.

Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching
Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was
still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep
hush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale
shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and
nothing happened except Laurie&#39;s quiet departure for the station.
Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the
storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at
Washington, haunted the girls.

It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary
the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the
bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother&#39;s easy
chair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as
she thought, &quot;Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.&quot;

She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great
change seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of
pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful
in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.
Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp
forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, &quot;Good-by, my
Beth.  Good-by!&quot;

As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to
the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and
then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,
exclaiming, under her breath, &quot;The fever&#39;s turned, she&#39;s sleepin&#39;
nat&#39;ral, her skin&#39;s damp, and she breathes easy.  Praise be given!  Oh,
my goodness me!&quot;

Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to
confirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite
heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, &quot;Yes,
my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time.  Keep
the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...&quot;

What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark
hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with
hearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and
cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,
with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and
breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.

&quot;If Mother would only come now!&quot; said Jo, as the winter night began to
wane.

&quot;See,&quot; said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, &quot;I thought
this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth&#39;s hand tomorrow if she--went
away from us.  But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put
it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she
sees will be the little rose, and Mother&#39;s face.&quot;

Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed
so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out
in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.

&quot;It looks like a fairy world,&quot; said Meg, smiling to herself, as she
stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.

&quot;Hark!&quot; cried Jo, starting to her feet.

Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,
and then Laurie&#39;s voice saying in a joyful whisper, &quot;Girls, she&#39;s come!
She&#39;s come!&quot;



CHAPTER NINETEEN

AMY&#39;S WILL

While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at
Aunt March&#39;s.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her
life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March
never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be
kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt
March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew&#39;s children,
though she didn&#39;t think it proper to confess it.  She really did her
best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old
people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can
sympathize with children&#39;s little cares and joys, make them feel at
home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and
receiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this
gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim
ways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable
than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,
as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So
she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught
sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy&#39;s soul, and made
her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.

She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned
spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then
she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck
escaped Aunt March&#39;s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much
carving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the
lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or
deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big
chair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was
a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one
hour for exercise or play, and didn&#39;t she enjoy it?

Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to
go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.
After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady
slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the
first page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with
outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed
to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the
worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her
youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go
to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep
before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.

If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that
she never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone
was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not
admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.
He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk
to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by
pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and
behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could
not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her
when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in
the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted
something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was
bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who
ever took any notice of the young lady.

Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with &#39;Madame&#39;, as she called her
mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but
Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that
she was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to
Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in
France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame&#39;s laces.  She
also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious
and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient
chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy&#39;s chief delight was
an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and
secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some
precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and
arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel
cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had
adorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt
March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her
wedding day, her lover&#39;s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the
queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made
of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,
Uncle March&#39;s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had
played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March&#39;s wedding ring,
too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most
precious jewel of them all.

&quot;Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?&quot; asked Esther,
who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.

&quot;I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I&#39;m
fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I
might,&quot; replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold
and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.

&quot;I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a
rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,&quot; said Esther,
eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.

&quot;Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads
hanging over your glass?&quot; asked Amy.

&quot;Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one
used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.&quot;

&quot;You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and
always come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could.&quot;

&quot;If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as
that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to
meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before
Madame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Would it be right for me to do so too?&quot; asked Amy, who in her
loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was
apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind
her of it.

&quot;It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the
little dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,
but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good
thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.&quot;

Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an
affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.
Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next
her room, hoping it would do her good.

&quot;I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March
dies,&quot; she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the
jewel cases one by one.

&quot;To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I
witnessed her will, and it is to be so,&quot; whispered Esther smiling.


&quot;How nice!  But I wish she&#39;d let us have them now. Procrastination is
not agreeable,&quot; observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.

&quot;It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The
first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,
and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you
when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming
manners.&quot;

&quot;Do you think so?  Oh, I&#39;ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely
ring!  It&#39;s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant&#39;s.  I do like Aunt
March after all.&quot; And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face
and a firm resolve to earn it.

From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady
complacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the
closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a
picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no
great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that
Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a
very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and
Amy&#39;s beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet
face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were
busy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and
hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought
her, and came every day to &#39;sit alone&#39; thinking good thoughts, and
praying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a
rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did
not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.

The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone
outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold
by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender
Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.
She missed her mother&#39;s help to understand and rule herself, but having
been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in
it confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden
seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and
be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.
In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her
will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her
possessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang
even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were
as precious as the old lady&#39;s jewels.

During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as
well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal
terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy
felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a
second witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse
herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for
company.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned
costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite
amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and
down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her
train about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on
this day that she did not hear Laurie&#39;s ring nor see his face peeping
in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and
tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting
oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She
was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as
Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along
in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,
imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh
or exclaim, &quot;Ain&#39;t we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!
Kiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!&quot;

Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it
should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.

&quot;Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to
consult you about a very serious matter,&quot; said Amy, when she had shown
her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.  &quot;That bird is the trial
of my life,&quot; she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,
while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.

&quot;Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to
let him out, and found a big spider there.  I poked it out, and it ran
under the bookcase.  Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and
peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his
eye, &#39;Come out and take a walk, my dear.&#39; I couldn&#39;t help laughing,
which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.&quot;

&quot;Did the spider accept the old fellow&#39;s invitation?&quot; asked Laurie,
yawning.

&quot;Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and
scrambled up on Aunt&#39;s chair, calling out, &#39;Catch her! Catch her! Catch
her!&#39; as I chased the spider.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie!  Oh, lor!&quot; cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie&#39;s toes.

&quot;I&#39;d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,&quot; cried Laurie,
shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely
croaked, &quot;Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!&quot;

&quot;Now I&#39;m ready,&quot; said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of
paper out of her pocket.  &quot;I want you to read that, please, and tell me
if it is legal and right.  I felt I ought to do it, for life is
uncertain and I don&#39;t want any ill feeling over my tomb.&quot;

Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,
read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the
spelling:

MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT

I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all
my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely

To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,
including frames.  Also my $100, to do what he likes with.

To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets--also
my likeness, and my medal, with much love.

To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it),
also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for
her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her &#39;little girl&#39;.

To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my
bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious plaster
rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.

To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau,
my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being
thin when she gets well.  And I herewith also leave her my regret that
I ever made fun of old Joanna.

To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay
portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn&#39;t any
neck.  Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction
any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.

To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a
looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind
him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,
especially Beth.

I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron
and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.

To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave
hoping she &#39;will remember me, when it you see&#39;.

And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be
satisfied and not blame the dead.  I forgive everyone, and trust we may
all meet when the trump shall sound.  Amen.

To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of
Nov.  Anni Domino 1861.

Amy Curtis March

Witnesses:

Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.


The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to
rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.

&quot;What put it into your head?  Did anyone tell you about Beth&#39;s giving
away her things?&quot; asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,
with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.

She explained and then asked anxiously, &quot;What about Beth?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I spoke, but as I did, I&#39;ll tell you.  She felt so ill one
day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to
you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She
was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest
of us, and her best love to Grandpa.  She never thought of a will.&quot;

Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a
great tear dropped on the paper.  Amy&#39;s face was full of trouble, but
she only said, &quot;Don&#39;t people put sort of postscripts to their wills,
sometimes?&quot;

&quot;Yes, &#39;codicils&#39;, they call them.&quot;

&quot;Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given
round to my friends.  I forgot it, but I want it done though it will
spoil my looks.&quot;

Laurie added it, smiling at Amy&#39;s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he
amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials.  But
when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,
&quot;Is there really any danger about Beth?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don&#39;t cry,
dear.&quot;  And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which
was very comforting.

When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the
twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,
feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the
loss of her gentle little sister.



CHAPTER TWENTY

CONFIDENTIAL

I don&#39;t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the
mother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard
to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,
merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that
Meg&#39;s tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,
healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little
rose and Mother&#39;s face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only
smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the
hungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the
girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand
which clung to hers even in sleep.

Hannah had &#39;dished up&#39; an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,
finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg
and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened
to her whispered account of Father&#39;s state, Mr. Brooke&#39;s promise to
stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the
homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie&#39;s hopeful face had
given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.

What a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay
without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So
quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,
and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah
mounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted
off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like
storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would
not leave Beth&#39;s side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to
look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some
recovered treasure.

Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well
that Aunt March actually &#39;sniffed&#39; herself, and never once said &quot;I told
you so&quot;.  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good
thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried
her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and
never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily
agreed in Laurie&#39;s opinion, that she behaved &#39;like a capital little
woman&#39;.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,
blessed her buttons, and begged her to &quot;come and take a walk, dear&quot;, in
his most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy
the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping
with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she
persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her
mother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was
stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt
March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual
fit of benignity.

After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till
night, and I&#39;m not sure that he would, had he not been effectually
roused by Amy&#39;s cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were
a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it
is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in
her mother&#39;s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and
compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They
were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object
when its purpose was explained to her.

&quot;On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,&quot; looking from the dusty
rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its
garland of evergreen.  &quot;It is an excellent plan to have some place
where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a
good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them
if we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning
this.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big
closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I&#39;ve tried to
make.  The woman&#39;s face is not good, it&#39;s too beautiful for me to draw,
but the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think
He was a little child once, for then I don&#39;t seem so far away, and that
helps me.&quot;

As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother&#39;s knee, Mrs.
March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said
nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute&#39;s pause, she
added gravely, &quot;I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.
Aunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and
put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she&#39;d like to
keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as
it&#39;s too big.  I&#39;d like to wear them Mother, can I?&quot;

&quot;They are very pretty, but I think you&#39;re rather too young for such
ornaments, Amy,&quot; said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,
with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint
guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.

&quot;I&#39;ll try not to be vain,&quot; said Amy.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I like it only
because it&#39;s so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story
wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.&quot;

&quot;Do you mean Aunt March?&quot; asked her mother, laughing.

&quot;No, to remind me not to be selfish.&quot;  Amy looked so earnest and
sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened
respectfully to the little plan.

&quot;I&#39;ve thought a great deal lately about my &#39;bundle of naughties&#39;, and
being selfish is the largest one in it, so I&#39;m going to try hard to
cure it, if I can.  Beth isn&#39;t selfish, and that&#39;s the reason everyone
loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People
wouldn&#39;t feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don&#39;t deserve to
have them, but I&#39;d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,
so I&#39;m going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I&#39;m apt to forget my
resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I
guess I should do better.  May we try this way?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your
ring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the
sincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to
Beth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you
home again.&quot;

That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the
traveler&#39;s safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth&#39;s room, and
finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her
fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.

&quot;What is it, deary?&quot; asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a
face which invited confidence.

&quot;I want to tell you something, Mother.&quot;

&quot;About Meg?&quot;

&quot;How quickly you guessed!  Yes, it&#39;s about her, and though it&#39;s a
little thing, it fidgets me.&quot;

&quot;Beth is asleep.  Speak low, and tell me all about it.  That Moffat
hasn&#39;t been here, I hope?&quot; asked Mrs. March rather sharply.

&quot;No.  I should have shut the door in his face if he had,&quot; said Jo,
settling herself on the floor at her mother&#39;s feet.  &quot;Last summer Meg
left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences&#39; and only one was returned.
We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he
liked Meg but didn&#39;t dare say so, she was so young and he so poor.
Now, isn&#39;t it a dreadful state of things?&quot;

&quot;Do you think Meg cares for him?&quot; asked Mrs. March, with an anxious
look.

&quot;Mercy me!  I don&#39;t know anything about love and such nonsense!&quot; cried
Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. &quot;In novels, the
girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,
and acting like fools.  Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.  She
eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight
in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit
when Teddy jokes about lovers.  I forbid him to do it, but he doesn&#39;t
mind me as he ought.&quot;

&quot;Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; cried Jo, staring.

&quot;Mr. Brooke.  I call him &#39;John&#39; now.  We fell into the way of doing so
at the hospital, and he likes it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear!  I know you&#39;ll take his part.  He&#39;s been good to Father, and
you won&#39;t send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to.  Mean
thing!  To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into
liking him.&quot; And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.

&quot;My dear, don&#39;t get angry about it, and I will tell you how it
happened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence&#39;s request, and was so
devoted to poor Father that we couldn&#39;t help getting fond of him.  He
was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved
her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry
him.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the
right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young
man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent
to Meg&#39;s engaging herself so young.&quot;

&quot;Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief
brewing.  I felt it, and now it&#39;s worse than I imagined. I just wish I
could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.&quot;

This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, &quot;Jo,
I confide in you and don&#39;t wish you to say anything to Meg yet.  When
John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her
feelings toward him.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will
be all up with her.  She&#39;s got such a soft heart, it will melt like
butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her.  She read the
short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me
when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn&#39;t think John an
ugly name, and she&#39;ll go and fall in love, and there&#39;s an end of peace
and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!  They&#39;ll go lovering
around the house, and we shall have to dodge.  Meg will be absorbed and
no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry
her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and
everything will be abominably uncomfortable.  Oh, dear me!  Why weren&#39;t
we all boys, then there wouldn&#39;t be any bother.&quot;

Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook
her fist at the reprehensible John.  Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked
up with an air of relief.

&quot;You don&#39;t like it, Mother?  I&#39;m glad of it.  Let&#39;s send him about his
business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as
we always have been.&quot;

&quot;I did wrong to sigh, Jo.  It is natural and right you should all go to
homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I
can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only
seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for
her.  Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in
any way, nor be married, before twenty.  If she and John love one
another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so.  She is
conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly.  My
pretty, tender hearted girl!  I hope things will go happily with her.&quot;

&quot;Hadn&#39;t you rather have her marry a rich man?&quot; asked Jo, as her
mother&#39;s voice faltered a little over the last words.

&quot;Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never
feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much.  I should
like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,
which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make
Meg comfortable.  I&#39;m not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a
fashionable position, or a great name for my girls.  If rank and money
come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and
enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine
happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is
earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.  I am
content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be
rich in the possession of a good man&#39;s heart, and that is better than a
fortune.&quot;

&quot;I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I&#39;m disappointed about Meg,
for I&#39;d planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of
luxury all her days.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice?&quot; asked Jo, looking up with a
brighter face.

&quot;He is younger than she, you know,&quot; began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...

&quot;Only a little, he&#39;s old for his age, and tall, and can be quite
grown-up in his manners if he likes.  Then he&#39;s rich and generous and
good, and loves us all, and I say it&#39;s a pity my plan is spoiled.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether
too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on.  Don&#39;t make
plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends.  We
can&#39;t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get &#39;romantic
rubbish&#39; as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.&quot;

&quot;Well, I won&#39;t, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and
getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten
it out.  I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from
growing up.  But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more&#39;s the pity!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that about flatirons and cats?&quot; asked Meg, as she crept into
the room with the finished letter in her hand.

&quot;Only one of my stupid speeches.  I&#39;m going to bed.  Come, Peggy,&quot; said
Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.

&quot;Quite right, and beautifully written.  Please add that I send my love
to John,&quot; said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it
back.

&quot;Do you call him &#39;John&#39;?&quot; asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes
looking down into her mother&#39;s.

&quot;Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,&quot;
replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.

&quot;I&#39;m glad of that, he is so lonely.  Good night, Mother, dear.  It is
so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,&quot; was Meg&#39;s answer.

The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went
away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, &quot;She
does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.&quot;



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE

Jo&#39;s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,
and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg
observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had
learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so
she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was
rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo
assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn
assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.
This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as
nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long
confinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as
she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was
an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.

She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a
mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of
it.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected
indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he
knew, then that he didn&#39;t care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,
he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling
indignant that he was not taken into his tutor&#39;s confidence, he set his
wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.

Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in
preparations for her father&#39;s return, but all of a sudden a change
seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike
herself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very
quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her
face.  To her mother&#39;s inquiries she answered that she was quite well,
and Jo&#39;s she silenced by begging to be let alone.

&quot;She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she&#39;s going very fast.
She&#39;s got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn&#39;t eat,
lies awake, and mopes in corners.  I caught her singing that song he
gave her, and once she said &#39;John&#39;, as you do, and then turned as red
as a poppy.  Whatever shall we do?&quot; said Jo, looking ready for any
measures, however violent.

&quot;Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father&#39;s
coming will settle everything,&quot; replied her mother.

&quot;Here&#39;s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals
mine,&quot; said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little
post office.

Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg
made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.

&quot;My child, what is it?&quot; cried her mother, running to her, while Jo
tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.

&quot;It&#39;s all a mistake, he didn&#39;t send it.  Oh, Jo, how could you do it?&quot;
and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite
broken.

&quot;Me!  I&#39;ve done nothing!  What&#39;s she talking about?&quot; cried Jo,
bewildered.

Meg&#39;s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from
her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, &quot;You wrote it, and
that bad boy helped you.  How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel
to us both?&quot;

Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note,
which was written in a peculiar hand.


&quot;My Dearest Margaret,

&quot;I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I
return.  I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would
consent if they knew that we adored one another.  Mr. Laurence will
help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me
happy.  I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send
one word of hope through Laurie to,

&quot;Your devoted John.&quot;


&quot;Oh, the little villain!  That&#39;s the way he meant to pay me for keeping
my word to Mother.  I&#39;ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over
to beg pardon,&quot; cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice.  But
her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...

&quot;Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.  You have played so many
pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.&quot;

&quot;On my word, Mother, I haven&#39;t!  I never saw that note before, and
don&#39;t know anything about it, as true as I live!&quot; said Jo, so earnestly
that they believed her.  &quot;If I had taken part in it I&#39;d have done it
better than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think
you&#39;d have known Mr. Brooke wouldn&#39;t write such stuff as that,&quot; she
added, scornfully tossing down the paper.

&quot;It&#39;s like his writing,&quot; faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in
her hand.

&quot;Oh, Meg, you didn&#39;t answer it?&quot; cried Mrs. March quickly.

&quot;Yes, I did!&quot; and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.

&quot;Here&#39;s a scrape!  Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and
be lectured.  I can&#39;t rest till I get hold of him.&quot; And Jo made for the
door again.

&quot;Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,
tell me the whole story,&quot; commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,
yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.

&quot;I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn&#39;t look as if he knew
anything about it,&quot; began Meg, without looking up. &quot;I was worried at
first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.
Brooke, so I thought you wouldn&#39;t mind if I kept my little secret for a
few days.  I&#39;m so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I
was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such
things to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I&#39;m paid for my silliness now.  I
never can look him in the face again.&quot;

&quot;What did you say to him?&quot; asked Mrs. March.

&quot;I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn&#39;t
wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.  I was very
grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,
for a long while.&quot;

Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,
exclaiming, with a laugh, &quot;You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who
was a pattern of prudence!  Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?&quot;

&quot;He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent
any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,
should take liberties with our names.  It&#39;s very kind and respectful,
but think how dreadful for me!&quot;

Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo
tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.  All of a sudden she
stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,
said decidedly, &quot;I don&#39;t believe Brooke ever saw either of these
letters.  Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with
because I wouldn&#39;t tell him my secret.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t have any secrets, Jo.  Tell it to Mother and keep out of
trouble, as I should have done,&quot; said Meg warningly.

&quot;Bless you, child!  Mother told me.&quot;

&quot;That will do, Jo.  I&#39;ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I
shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at
once.&quot;

Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke&#39;s real feelings.
&quot;Now, dear, what are your own?  Do you love him enough to wait till he
can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the
present?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been so scared and worried, I don&#39;t want to have anything to do
with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,&quot; answered Meg petulantly.
&quot;If John doesn&#39;t know anything about this nonsense, don&#39;t tell him, and
make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues.  I won&#39;t be deceived and plagued
and made a fool of. It&#39;s a shame!&quot;

Seeing Meg&#39;s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by
this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire
silence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie&#39;s step
was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received
the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he
wouldn&#39;t come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March&#39;s face, and
stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.
Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a
sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of
voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened
during that interview the girls never knew.

When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such
a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it
wise to betray the fact.  Meg received his humble apology, and was much
comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.

&quot;I&#39;ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan&#39;t drag it out of
me, so you&#39;ll forgive me, Meg, and I&#39;ll do anything to show how
out-and-out sorry I am,&quot; he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.

&quot;I&#39;ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn&#39;t think
you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,&quot; replied Meg, trying to hide
her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.

&quot;It was altogether abominable, and I don&#39;t deserve to be spoken to for
a month, but you will, though, won&#39;t you?&quot; And Laurie folded his hands
together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his
irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him
in spite of his scandalous behavior.

Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March&#39;s grave face relaxed, in spite of her
efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone
for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm
before the injured damsel.

Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and
succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire
disapprobation.  Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed
no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till
the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked
off without a word.

As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and
when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for
Teddy.  After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and
armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.

&quot;Is Mr. Laurence in?&quot; asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming
downstairs.

&quot;Yes, Miss, but I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s seeable just yet.&quot;

&quot;Why not?  Is he ill?&quot;

&quot;La, no Miss, but he&#39;s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of
his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I
dursn&#39;t go nigh him.&quot;

&quot;Where is Laurie?&quot;

&quot;Shut up in his room, and he won&#39;t answer, though I&#39;ve been a-tapping.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to become of the dinner, for it&#39;s ready, and
there&#39;s no one to eat it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go and see what the matter is.  I&#39;m not afraid of either of them.&quot;

Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie&#39;s little study.

&quot;Stop that, or I&#39;ll open the door and make you!&quot; called out the young
gentleman in a threatening tone.

Jo immediately knocked again.  The door flew open, and in she bounced
before Laurie could recover from his surprise.  Seeing that he really
was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite
expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,
&quot;Please forgive me for being so cross.  I came to make it up, and can&#39;t
go away till I have.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right.  Get up, and don&#39;t be a goose, Jo,&quot; was the cavalier
reply to her petition.

&quot;Thank you, I will.  Could I ask what&#39;s the matter?  You don&#39;t look
exactly easy in your mind.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been shaken, and I won&#39;t bear it!&quot; growled Laurie indignantly.

&quot;Who did it?&quot; demanded Jo.

&quot;Grandfather.  If it had been anyone else I&#39;d have...&quot; And the injured
youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.

&quot;That&#39;s nothing.  I often shake you, and you don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Jo
soothingly.

&quot;Pooh!  You&#39;re a girl, and it&#39;s fun, but I&#39;ll allow no man to shake me!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like
a thundercloud as you do now.  Why were you treated so?&quot;

&quot;Just because I wouldn&#39;t say what your mother wanted me for. I&#39;d
promised not to tell, and of course I wasn&#39;t going to break my word.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?&quot;

&quot;No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth.  I&#39;d have told my part of the scrape, if I could without
bringing Meg in.  As I couldn&#39;t, I held my tongue, and bore the
scolding till the old gentleman collared me.  Then I bolted, for fear I
should forget myself.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t nice, but he&#39;s sorry, I know, so go down and make up.  I&#39;ll
help you.&quot;

&quot;Hanged if I do!  I&#39;m not going to be lectured and pummelled by
everyone, just for a bit of a frolic.  I was sorry about Meg, and
begged pardon like a man, but I won&#39;t do it again, when I wasn&#39;t in the
wrong.&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t know that.&quot;

&quot;He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.  It&#39;s no use,
Jo, he&#39;s got to learn that I&#39;m able to take care of myself, and don&#39;t
need anyone&#39;s apron string to hold on by.&quot;

&quot;What pepper pots you are!&quot; sighed Jo.  &quot;How do you mean to settle this
affair?&quot;

&quot;Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can&#39;t tell
him what the fuss&#39;s about.&quot;

&quot;Bless you!  He won&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t go down till he does.&quot;

&quot;Now, Teddy, be sensible.  Let it pass, and I&#39;ll explain what I can.
You can&#39;t stay here, so what&#39;s the use of being melodramatic?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t intend to stay here long, anyway.  I&#39;ll slip off and take a
journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he&#39;ll come round fast
enough.&quot;

&quot;I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t preach.  I&#39;ll go to Washington and see Brooke.  It&#39;s gay there,
and I&#39;ll enjoy myself after the troubles.&quot;

&quot;What fun you&#39;d have!  I wish I could run off too,&quot; said Jo, forgetting
her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.

&quot;Come on, then!  Why not?  You go and surprise your father, and I&#39;ll
stir up old Brooke.  It would be a glorious joke.  Let&#39;s do it, Jo.
We&#39;ll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once.
I&#39;ve got money enough.  It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to
your father.&quot;

For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was,
it just suited her.  She was tired of care and confinement, longed for
change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel
charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun.  Her eyes kindled as
they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house
opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.

&quot;If I was a boy, we&#39;d run away together, and have a capital time, but
as I&#39;m a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don&#39;t tempt
me, Teddy, it&#39;s a crazy plan.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the fun of it,&quot; began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him
and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.

&quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; cried Jo, covering her ears.  &quot;&#39;Prunes and prisms&#39;
are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it.  I came here to
moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.&quot;

&quot;I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had
more spirit,&quot; began Laurie insinuatingly.

&quot;Bad boy, be quiet!  Sit down and think of your own sins, don&#39;t go
making me add to mine.  If I get your grandpa to apologize for the
shaking, will you give up running away?&quot; asked Jo seriously.

&quot;Yes, but you won&#39;t do it,&quot; answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but
felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.

&quot;If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,&quot; muttered Jo, as she
walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head
propped up on both hands.

&quot;Come in!&quot; and Mr. Laurence&#39;s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as
Jo tapped at his door.

&quot;It&#39;s only me, Sir, come to return a book,&quot; she said blandly, as she
entered.

&quot;Want any more?&quot; asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but
trying not to show it.

&quot;Yes, please.  I like old Sam so well, I think I&#39;ll try the second
volume,&quot; returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second
dose of Boswell&#39;s Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.

The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the
shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.  Jo skipped up, and
sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was
really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her
visit.  Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in
her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced
round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward
on the floor.

&quot;What has that boy been about?  Don&#39;t try to shield him.  I know he has
been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home.  I can&#39;t get a
word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he
bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.&quot;

&quot;He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word
to anyone,&quot; began Jo reluctantly.

&quot;That won&#39;t do.  He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you
softhearted girls.  If he&#39;s done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg
pardon, and be punished.  Out with it, Jo. I won&#39;t be kept in the dark.&quot;

Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have
gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,
and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and
brave it out.

&quot;Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.  Mother forbade it.  Laurie has confessed,
asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.  We don&#39;t keep silence to
shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you
interfere.  Please don&#39;t.  It was partly my fault, but it&#39;s all right
now.  So let&#39;s forget it, and talk about the _Rambler_ or something
pleasant.&quot;

&quot;Hang the _Rambler!_  Come down and give me your word that this
harum-scarum boy of mine hasn&#39;t done anything ungrateful or
impertinent.  If he has, after all your kindness to him, I&#39;ll thrash
him with my own hands.&quot;

The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the
irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,
whatever he might say to the contrary.  She obediently descended, and
made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or
forgetting the truth.

&quot;Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and
not from obstinacy, I&#39;ll forgive him. He&#39;s a stubborn fellow and hard
to manage,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if
he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with
an air of relief.

&quot;So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king&#39;s horses and
all the king&#39;s men couldn&#39;t,&quot; said Jo, trying to say a kind word for
her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into
another.

&quot;You think I&#39;m not kind to him, hey?&quot; was the sharp answer.

&quot;Oh, dear no, Sir.  You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a
trifle hasty when he tries your patience.  Don&#39;t you think you are?&quot;

Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,
though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief
and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the
table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, &quot;You&#39;re right, girl, I am!
I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how
it will end, if we go on so.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you, he&#39;ll run away.&quot; Jo was sorry for that speech the
minute it was made.  She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear
much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.

Mr. Laurence&#39;s ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a
troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his
table.  It was Laurie&#39;s father, who had run away in his youth, and
married against the imperious old man&#39;s will. Jo fancied he remembered
and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.

&quot;He won&#39;t do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it
sometimes, when he gets tired of studying.  I often think I should like
to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may
advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.&quot;

She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently
taking the whole as a joke.

&quot;You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?  Where&#39;s your respect for
me, and your proper bringing up?  Bless the boys and girls!  What
torments they are, yet we can&#39;t do without them,&quot; he said, pinching her
cheeks good-humoredly.  &quot;Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell
him it&#39;s all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his
grandfather.  I won&#39;t bear it.&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t come, Sir.  He feels badly because you didn&#39;t believe him
when he said he couldn&#39;t tell.  I think the shaking hurt his feelings
very much.&quot;

Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began
to laugh, and she knew the day was won.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I
suppose.  What the dickens does the fellow expect?&quot; and the old
gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.

&quot;If I were you, I&#39;d write him an apology, Sir.  He says he won&#39;t come
down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an
absurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and
bring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is
better than talking.  I&#39;ll carry it up, and teach him his duty.&quot;

Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying
slowly, &quot;You&#39;re a sly puss, but I don&#39;t mind being managed by you and
Beth.  Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this
nonsense.&quot;

The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to
another after offering some deep insult.  Jo dropped a kiss on the top
of Mr. Laurence&#39;s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under
Laurie&#39;s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,
decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door
locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly
away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for
her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of
countenance, &quot;What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?&quot; he
added, laughing.

&quot;No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.&quot;

&quot;Ah!  I got it all round.  Even you cast me off over there, and I felt
just ready to go to the deuce,&quot; he began apologetically.

&quot;Don&#39;t talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my
son.&quot;

&quot;I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil
my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an
end,&quot; he said dolefully.

&quot;Go and eat your dinner, you&#39;ll feel better after it.  Men always croak
when they are hungry,&quot; and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.

&quot;That&#39;s a &#39;label&#39; on my &#39;sect&#39;,&quot; answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he
went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was
quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the
rest of the day.

Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but
the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered.
She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good
deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her
sister&#39;s desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the
words, &#39;Mrs. John Brooke&#39;, whereat she groaned tragically and cast it
into the fire, feeling that Laurie&#39;s prank had hastened the evil day
for her.



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

PLEASANT MEADOWS

Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.
The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning
early in the new year.  Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all
day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time
with doll&#39;s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.  Her once
active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily
airing about the house in her strong arms.  Meg cheerfully blackened
and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for &#39;the dear&#39;,
while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving
away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to
accept.

As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,
and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible
or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry
Christmas.  Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had
bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.
After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered
effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were
rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.

Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid
Christmas Day.  Hannah &#39;felt in her bones&#39; that it was going to be an
unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for
everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success.  To
begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth
felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother&#39;s
gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the
window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.  The Unquenchables had
done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had
worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.  Out in the garden
stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of
fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a
perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a
Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.

    THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH

    God bless you, dear Queen Bess!
    May nothing you dismay,
    But health and peace and happiness
    Be yours, this Christmas day.

    Here&#39;s fruit to feed our busy bee,
    And flowers for her nose.
    Here&#39;s music for her pianee,
    An afghan for her toes,

    A portrait of Joanna, see,
    By Raphael No. 2,
    Who laboured with great industry
    To make it fair and true.

    Accept a ribbon red, I beg,
    For Madam Purrer&#39;s tail,
    And ice cream made by lovely Peg,
    A Mont Blanc in a pail.

    Their dearest love my makers laid
    Within my breast of snow.
    Accept it, and the Alpine maid,
    From Laurie and from Jo.

How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring
in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented
them.

&quot;I&#39;m so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn&#39;t
hold one drop more,&quot; said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo
carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to
refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the &#39;Jungfrau&#39; had
sent her.

&quot;So am I,&quot; added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the
long-desired _Undine and Sintram_.

&quot;I&#39;m sure I am,&quot; echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the
Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.

&quot;Of course I am!&quot; cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first
silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. &quot;How can I be
otherwise?&quot; said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her
husband&#39;s letter to Beth&#39;s smiling face, and her hand caressed the
brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the
girls had just fastened on her breast.

Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the
delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.  Half an hour
after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one
drop more, the drop came.  Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his
head in very quietly.  He might just as well have turned a somersault
and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed
excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped
up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, &quot;Here&#39;s another
Christmas present for the March family.&quot;

Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away
somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,
leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and
couldn&#39;t.  Of course there was a general stampede, and for several
minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things
were done, and no one said a word.

Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.
Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by
Laurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,
as he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled
over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her
father&#39;s boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first
to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, &quot;Hush!
Remember Beth.&quot;

But it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper
appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and
Beth ran straight into her father&#39;s arms.  Never mind what happened
just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the
bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.

It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight
again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat
turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the
kitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke
for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly
remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he
precipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,
which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.

Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the
fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage
of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most
estimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just
there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,
looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you
to imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,
rather abruptly, if he wouldn&#39;t like to have something to eat.  Jo saw
and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and
beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, &quot;I hate
estimable young men with brown eyes!&quot;

There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat
turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,
browned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one&#39;s
mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a
honeypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,
&quot;For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it&#39;s a merrycle I didn&#39;t
roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin&#39;
of it in a cloth.&quot;

Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom
Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie&#39;s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs
stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her
father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank
healths, told stories, sang songs, &#39;reminisced&#39;, as the old folks say,
and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the
girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and
as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.

&quot;Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected
to have.  Do you remember?&quot; asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had
followed a long conversation about many things.

&quot;Rather a pleasant year on the whole!&quot; said Meg, smiling at the fire,
and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.

&quot;I think it&#39;s been a pretty hard one,&quot; observed Amy, watching the light
shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over, because we&#39;ve got you back,&quot; whispered Beth, who
sat on her father&#39;s knee.

&quot;Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially
the latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the
burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,&quot; said Mr. March,
looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered
round him.

&quot;How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?&quot; asked Jo.

&quot;Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I&#39;ve made several
discoveries today.&quot;

&quot;Oh, tell us what they are!&quot; cried Meg, who sat beside him.

&quot;Here is one.&quot; And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his
chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and
two or three little hard spots on the palm.  &quot;I remember a time when
this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.
It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this
seeming blemishes I read a little history.  A burnt offering has been
made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than
blisters, and I&#39;m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will
last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my
dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white
hands or fashionable accomplishments.  I&#39;m proud to shake this good,
industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it
away.&quot;

If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it
in the hearty pressure of her father&#39;s hand and the approving smile he
gave her.

&quot;What about Jo?  Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard
and been so very, very good to me,&quot; said Beth in her father&#39;s ear.

He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an
unusually mild expression in her face.

&quot;In spite of the curly crop, I don&#39;t see the &#39;son Jo&#39; whom I left a
year ago,&quot; said Mr. March.  &quot;I see a young lady who pins her collar
straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,
nor lies on the rug as she used to do.  Her face is rather thin and
pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for
it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn&#39;t bounce, but
moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly
way which delights me.  I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a
strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite
satisfied. I don&#39;t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,
but I do know that in all Washington I couldn&#39;t find anything beautiful
enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent
me.&quot;

Jo&#39;s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew
rosy in the firelight as she received her father&#39;s praise, feeling that
she did deserve a portion of it.

&quot;Now, Beth,&quot; said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.

&quot;There&#39;s so little of her, I&#39;m afraid to say much, for fear she will
slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,&quot;
began their father cheerfully.  But recollecting how nearly he had lost
her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his
own, &quot;I&#39;ve got you safe, my Beth, and I&#39;ll keep you so, please God.&quot;

After a minute&#39;s silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket
at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...

&quot;I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her
mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on
every one with patience and good humor.  I also observe that she does
not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very
pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to
think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try
and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay
figures.  I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a
graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable
daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.&quot;

&quot;What are you thinking of, Beth?&quot; asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her
father and told about her ring.

&quot;I read in _Pilgrim&#39;s Progress_ today how, after many troubles,
Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies
bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,
before they went on to their journey&#39;s end,&quot; answered Beth, adding, as
she slipped out of her father&#39;s arms and went to the instrument, &quot;It&#39;s
singing time now, and I want to be in my old place.  I&#39;ll try to sing
the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard.  I made the
music for Father, because he likes the verses.&quot;

So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and
in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her
own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song
for her.


    He that is down need fear no fall,
    He that is low no pride.
    He that is humble ever shall
    Have God to be his guide.

    I am content with what I have,
    Little be it, or much.
    And, Lord!  Contentment still I crave,
    Because Thou savest such.

    Fulness to them a burden is,
    That go on pilgrimage.
    Here little, and hereafter bliss,
    Is best from age to age!



CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION

Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered
about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait
upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed
by kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth&#39;s sofa, with
the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then
&#39;to peek at the dear man&#39;, nothing seemed needed to complete their
happiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,
though none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one
another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had
sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke&#39;s
umbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,
and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John&#39;s name
was mentioned.  Amy said, &quot;Everyone seemed waiting for something, and
couldn&#39;t settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,&quot;
and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn&#39;t run over as
usual.

Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed
suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one
knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands
imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave
himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,
and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.

&quot;What does the goose mean?&quot; said Meg, laughing and trying to look
unconscious.

&quot;He&#39;s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn&#39;t
it?&quot; answered Jo scornfully.

&quot;Don&#39;t say my John, it isn&#39;t proper or true,&quot; but Meg&#39;s voice lingered
over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  &quot;Please don&#39;t
plague me, Jo, I&#39;ve told you I don&#39;t care much about him, and there
isn&#39;t to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as
before.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t, for something has been said, and Laurie&#39;s mischief has
spoiled you for me.  I see it, and so does Mother.  You are not like
your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.  I don&#39;t mean
to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all
settled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and
have it over quickly,&quot; said Jo pettishly.

&quot;I can&#39;t say anything till he speaks, and he won&#39;t, because Father said
I was too young,&quot; began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little
smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on
that point.

&quot;If he did speak, you wouldn&#39;t know what to say, but would cry or
blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided
no.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should
say, for I&#39;ve planned it all, so I needn&#39;t be taken unawares.  There&#39;s
no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.&quot;

Jo couldn&#39;t help smiling at the important air which Meg had
unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color
varying in her cheeks.

&quot;Would you mind telling me what you&#39;d say?&quot; asked Jo more respectfully.

&quot;Not at all.  You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,
and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own
affairs of this sort.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mean to have any.  It&#39;s fun to watch other people philander, but
I should feel like a fool doing it myself,&quot; said Jo, looking alarmed at
the thought.

&quot;I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.&quot;  Meg
spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often
seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.

&quot;I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,&quot; said Jo,
rudely shortening her sister&#39;s little reverie.

&quot;Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, &#39;Thank you, Mr.
Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young
to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let
us be friends as we were.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Hum, that&#39;s stiff and cool enough!  I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ll ever say
it, and I know he won&#39;t be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the
rejected lovers in books, you&#39;ll give in, rather than hurt his
feelings.&quot;

&quot;No, I won&#39;t.  I shall tell him I&#39;ve made up my mind, and shall walk
out of the room with dignity.&quot;

Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified
exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to
sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam
in a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when
someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was
anything but hospitable.

&quot;Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your
father finds himself today,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused
as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.

&quot;It&#39;s very well, he&#39;s in the rack.  I&#39;ll get him, and tell it you are
here.&quot;  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in
her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her
speech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to
sidle toward the door, murmuring...

&quot;Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I&#39;ll call her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?&quot; and Mr. Brooke looked so
hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She
blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called
her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and
sweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at
her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said
gratefully...

&quot;How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish
I could thank you for it.&quot;

&quot;Shall I tell you how?&quot; asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast
in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown
eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away
and to stop and listen.

&quot;Oh no, please don&#39;t, I&#39;d rather not,&quot; she said, trying to withdraw her
hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.

&quot;I won&#39;t trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,
Meg.  I love you so much, dear,&quot; added Mr. Brooke tenderly.

This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn&#39;t make
it.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, &quot;I don&#39;t
know,&quot; so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish
little reply.

He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself
as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in
his most persuasive tone, &quot;Will you try and find out?  I want to know
so much, for I can&#39;t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I
am to have my reward in the end or not.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m too young,&quot; faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet
rather enjoying it.

&quot;I&#39;ll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.
Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?&quot;

&quot;Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .&quot;

&quot;Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than
German,&quot; broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that
she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.

His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg
saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the
satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.  This nettled
her.  Annie Moffat&#39;s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind,
and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little
women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her.  She felt
excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a
capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, &quot;I
don&#39;t choose.  Please go away and let me be!&quot;

Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling
about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it
rather bewildered him.

&quot;Do you really mean that?&quot; he asked anxiously, following her as she
walked away.

&quot;Yes, I do.  I don&#39;t want to be worried about such things. Father says
I needn&#39;t, it&#39;s too soon and I&#39;d rather not.&quot;

&quot;Mayn&#39;t I hope you&#39;ll change your mind by-and-by?  I&#39;ll wait and say
nothing till you have had more time.  Don&#39;t play with me, Meg.  I
didn&#39;t think that of you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think of me at all.  I&#39;d rather you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Meg, taking
a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover&#39;s patience and her own power.

He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel
heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor
tramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so
wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of
herself.  What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had
not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.

The old lady couldn&#39;t resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had
met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March&#39;s arrival,
drove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back
part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to
surprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started
as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.

&quot;Bless me, what&#39;s all this?&quot; cried the old lady with a rap of her cane
as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.

&quot;It&#39;s Father&#39;s friend.  I&#39;m so surprised to see you!&quot; stammered Meg,
feeling that she was in for a lecture now.

&quot;That&#39;s evident,&quot; returned Aunt March, sitting down.  &quot;But what is
Father&#39;s friend saying to make you look like a peony? There&#39;s mischief
going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,&quot; with another rap.

&quot;We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,&quot; began Meg,
wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.

&quot;Brooke?  That boy&#39;s tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about
it.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father&#39;s letters,
and I made her tell me.  You haven&#39;t gone and accepted him, child?&quot;
cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.

&quot;Hush! He&#39;ll hear.  Shan&#39;t I call Mother?&quot; said Meg, much troubled.

&quot;Not yet.  I&#39;ve something to say to you, and I must free my mind at
once.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one
penny of my money ever goes to you.  Remember that, and be a sensible
girl,&quot; said the old lady impressively.

Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of
opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of
us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and
in love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would
probably have declared she couldn&#39;t think of it, but as she was
preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind
that she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision
easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with
unusual spirit.

&quot;I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money
to anyone you like,&quot; she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.

&quot;Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You&#39;ll be
sorry for it by-and-by, when you&#39;ve tried love in a cottage and found
it a failure.&quot;

&quot;It can&#39;t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,&quot; retorted
Meg.

Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did
not know her in this new mood.  Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so
brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to
love him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and
after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she
could, &quot;Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it
kindly, and don&#39;t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake
at the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It&#39;s
your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.&quot;

&quot;Father and Mother don&#39;t think so.  They like John though he is poor.&quot;

&quot;Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of
babies.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of it,&quot; cried Meg stoutly.

Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. &quot;This Rook is
poor and hasn&#39;t got any rich relations, has he?&quot;

&quot;No, but he has many warm friends.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t live on friends, try it and see how cool they&#39;ll grow.  He
hasn&#39;t any business, has he?&quot;

&quot;Not yet.  Mr. Laurence is going to help him.&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t last long.  James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and
not to be depended on.  So you intend to marry a man without money,
position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when
you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better?
I thought you had more sense, Meg.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t do better if I waited half my life!  John is good and wise,
he&#39;s got heaps of talent, he&#39;s willing to work and sure to get on, he&#39;s
so energetic and brave.  Everyone likes and respects him, and I&#39;m proud
to think he cares for me, though I&#39;m so poor and young and silly,&quot; said
Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.

&quot;He knows you have got rich relations, child.  That&#39;s the secret of his
liking, I suspect.&quot;

&quot;Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing?  John is above such
meanness, and I won&#39;t listen to you a minute if you talk so,&quot; cried Meg
indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady&#39;s
suspicions.  &quot;My John wouldn&#39;t marry for money, any more than I would.
We are willing to work and we mean to wait.  I&#39;m not afraid of being
poor, for I&#39;ve been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him
because he loves me, and I...&quot;

Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn&#39;t made up
her mind, that she had told &#39;her John&#39; to go away, and that he might be
overhearing her inconsistent remarks.

Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her
pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl&#39;s happy young
face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.

&quot;Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!  You are a willful child,
and you&#39;ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won&#39;t
stop.  I&#39;m disappointed in you, and haven&#39;t spirits to see your father
now.  Don&#39;t expect anything from me when you are married.  Your Mr.
Brooke&#39;s friends must take care of you.  I&#39;m done with you forever.&quot;

And slamming the door in Meg&#39;s face, Aunt March drove off in high
dudgeon.  She seemed to take all the girl&#39;s courage with her, for when
left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.
Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.
Brooke, who said all in one breath, &quot;I couldn&#39;t help hearing, Meg.
Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care
for me a little bit.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know how much till she abused you,&quot; began Meg.

&quot;And I needn&#39;t go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?&quot;

Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the
stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced
herself forever in Jo&#39;s eyes by meekly whispering, &quot;Yes,  John,&quot; and
hiding her face on Mr. Brooke&#39;s waistcoat.

Fifteen minutes after Aunt March&#39;s departure, Jo came softly
downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound
within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to
herself, &quot;She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is
settled.  I&#39;ll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.&quot;

But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the
threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth
nearly as wide open as her eyes.  Going in to exult over a fallen enemy
and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an
objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid
enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister
enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject
submission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had
suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables
actually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and
saw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but &#39;that man&#39;, as
Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the
astonished newcomer, &quot;Sister Jo, congratulate us!&quot;

That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and
making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a
word.  Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming
tragically as she burst into the room, &quot;Oh, do somebody go down quick!
John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!&quot;

Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon
the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news
to Beth and Amy.  The little girls, however, considered it a most
agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,
so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles
to the rats.

Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great
deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends
by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his
plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.

The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which
he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both
looking so happy that Jo hadn&#39;t the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy
was very much impressed by John&#39;s devotion and Meg&#39;s dignity, Beth
beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the
young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly
evident Aunt March was right in calling them as &#39;unworldly as a pair of
babies&#39;.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old
room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the
family began there.

&quot;You can&#39;t say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?&quot; said
Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she
was planning to make.

&quot;No, I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t.  How much has happened since I said that! It
seems a year ago,&quot; answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far
above such common things as bread and butter.

&quot;The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the
changes have begun,&quot; said Mrs. March.  &quot;In most families there comes,
now and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it
ends well, after all.&quot;

&quot;Hope the next will end better,&quot; muttered Jo, who found it very hard to
see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few
persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or
lessened in any way.

&quot;I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if
I live to work out my plans,&quot; said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if
everything had become possible to him now.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it seem very long to wait?&quot; asked Amy, who was in a hurry for
the wedding.

&quot;I&#39;ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short
time to me,&quot; answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen
there before.

&quot;You have only to wait, I am to do the work,&quot; said John beginning his
labors by picking up Meg&#39;s napkin, with an expression which caused Jo
to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the
front door banged, &quot;Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible
conversation.&quot;

But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good
spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for &#39;Mrs. John Brooke&#39;,
and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had
been brought about by his excellent management.

&quot;I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when
he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it&#39;s done though the sky
falls,&quot; said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his
congratulations.

&quot;Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for
the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,&quot; answered Mr.
Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.

&quot;I&#39;ll come if I&#39;m at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo&#39;s face
alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don&#39;t look
festive, ma&#39;am, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked Laurie, following her into a
corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.

&quot;I don&#39;t approve of the match, but I&#39;ve made up my mind to bear it, and
shall not say a word against it,&quot; said Jo solemnly.  &quot;You can&#39;t know
how hard it is for me to give up Meg,&quot; she continued with a little
quiver in her voice.

&quot;You don&#39;t give her up.  You only go halves,&quot; said Laurie consolingly.

&quot;It can never be the same again.  I&#39;ve lost my dearest friend,&quot; sighed
Jo.

&quot;You&#39;ve got me, anyhow.  I&#39;m not good for much, I know, but I&#39;ll stand
by you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!&quot; and Laurie
meant what he said.

&quot;I know you will, and I&#39;m ever so much obliged.  You are always a great
comfort to me, Teddy,&quot; returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.

&quot;Well, now, don&#39;t be dismal, there&#39;s a good fellow.  It&#39;s all right you
see.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,
Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her
own little house.  We&#39;ll have capital times after she is gone, for I
shall be through college before long, and then we&#39;ll go abroad on some
nice trip or other.  Wouldn&#39;t that console you?&quot;

&quot;I rather think it would, but there&#39;s no knowing what may happen in
three years,&quot; said Jo thoughtfully.

&quot;That&#39;s true.  Don&#39;t you wish you could take a look forward and see
where we shall all be then?  I do,&quot; returned Laurie.

&quot;I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so
happy now, I don&#39;t believe they could be much improved.&quot; And Jo&#39;s eyes
went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the
prospect was a pleasant one.

Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of
the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing
the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light
of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not
copy.  Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who
held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead
him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low
seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie,
leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly
head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long
glass which reflected them both.


So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  Whether it ever
rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the
domestic drama called _Little Women_.







LITTLE WOMEN PART 2

In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg&#39;s wedding...



CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

GOSSIP

In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg&#39;s wedding with free
minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.
And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too
much &#39;lovering&#39; in the story, as I fear they may (I&#39;m not afraid the
young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,
&quot;What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a
dashing young neighbor over the way?&quot;

The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the
quiet family.  The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with
his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature
as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better
than learning, the charity which calls all mankind &#39;brother&#39;, the piety
that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.

These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which
shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many
admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as
naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard
experience had distilled no bitter drop.  Earnest young men found the
gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled
women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the
gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.  Sinners told their sins to the
pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved.  Gifted men found
a companion in him.  Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions
than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were
beautiful and true, although &#39;they wouldn&#39;t pay&#39;.

To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so
they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his
books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,
anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned
in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred
words, husband and father.

The girls gave their hearts into their mother&#39;s keeping, their souls
into their father&#39;s, and to both parents, who lived and labored so
faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and
bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and
outlives death.

Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we
saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg&#39;s affairs that the
hospitals and homes still full of wounded &#39;boys&#39; and soldiers&#39; widows,
decidedly miss the motherly missionary&#39;s visits.

John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent
home, and not allowed to return.  He received no stars or bars, but he
deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love
are very precious when both are in full bloom.  Perfectly resigned to
his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for
business, and earning a home for Meg.  With the good sense and sturdy
independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence&#39;s more
generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better
satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any
risks with borrowed money.

Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly
in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for
love is a great beautifier.  She had her girlish ambitions and hopes,
and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life
must begin.  Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg
couldn&#39;t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,
and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have
the same.  But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she
thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little
home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking
over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright
that she forgot Sallie&#39;s splendor and felt herself the richest,
happiest girl in Christendom.

Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to
Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of
the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would
have served a far harder mistress.  So she gave her mornings to duty,
her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted
herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the
fever was a thing of the past.  Not an invalid exactly, but never again
the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and
serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone&#39;s friend,
and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had
learned to know it.

As long as _The Spread Eagle_ paid her a dollar a column for her
&#39;rubbish&#39;, as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun
her little romances diligently.  But great plans fermented in her busy
brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a
slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to
place the name of March upon the roll of fame.

Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was
now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please
himself.  A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,
and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to
get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being
spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,
if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the
kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who
watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any
means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and
believed in him with all their hearts.

Being only &#39;a glorious human boy&#39;, of course he frolicked and flirted,
grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions
ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came
perilously near suspension and expulsion.  But as high spirits and the
love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save
himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible
power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection.  In fact, he
rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the
girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors,
dignified professors, and vanquished enemies.  The &#39;men of my class&#39;,
were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits
of &#39;our fellows&#39;, and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of
these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.

Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among
them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of
fascination with which she was endowed.  Meg was too much absorbed in
her private and particular John to care for any other lords of
creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how
Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element,
and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly
attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than
the decorums prescribed for young ladies.  They all liked Jo immensely,
but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying
the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy&#39;s shrine.  And speaking
of sentiment brings us very naturally to the &#39;Dovecote&#39;.

That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for
Meg&#39;s first home.  Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly
appropriate to the gentle lovers who &#39;went on together like a pair of
turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo&#39;.  It was a tiny house,
with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket
handkerchief in the front.  Here Meg meant to have a fountain,
shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present
the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a
dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,
undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was
merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.
But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no
fault from garret to cellar.  To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was
fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in
whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit,
and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of
precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin.  But
once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more
complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the
furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.  There were no
marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little
parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a
stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the
pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the
loving messages they brought.

I don&#39;t think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty
because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer
could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy&#39;s
artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with
good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her
mother put away Meg&#39;s few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally
certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and
neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,
and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute &#39;Mis.  Brooke came
home&#39;.  I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a
supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to
last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different
kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.

People who hire all these things done for them never know what they
lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,
and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest,
from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was
eloquent of home love and tender forethought.

What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping
excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter
arose over Laurie&#39;s ridiculous bargains.  In his love of jokes, this
young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as
ever.  His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits
some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper.  Now
a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which
fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the
knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left
the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one&#39;s hands,
infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the
deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for
odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own
steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.

In vain Meg begged him to stop.  John laughed at him, and Jo called him
&#39;Mr. Toodles&#39;.  He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee
ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week
beheld some fresh absurdity.

Everything was done at last, even to Amy&#39;s arranging different colored
soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth&#39;s setting the
table for the first meal.

&quot;Are you satisfied?  Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you
should be happy here?&quot; asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went
through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling
together more tenderly than ever.

&quot;Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that
I can&#39;t talk about it,&quot; with a look that was far better than words.

&quot;If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,&quot; said Amy,
coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether
the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.

&quot;Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try
her way first.  There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my
errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to
keep me from getting lazy or homesick,&quot; answered Meg tranquilly.

&quot;Sallie Moffat has four,&quot; began Amy.

&quot;If Meg had four, the house wouldn&#39;t hold them, and master and missis
would have to camp in the garden,&quot; broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big
blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.

&quot;Sallie isn&#39;t a poor man&#39;s wife, and many maids are in keeping with her
fine establishment.  Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling
that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in
the big one.  It&#39;s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave
themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I
was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get
torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got
heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she
does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants
laugh at her,&quot; said Meg.

&quot;I did after a while, not to &#39;mess&#39; but to learn of Hannah how things
should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.  It was play
then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only
possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little
girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.  You
begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will
be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress
of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if
she wishes to be well and honestly served.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mother, I&#39;m sure of that,&quot; said Meg, listening respectfully to
the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all
absorbing subject of house keeping.  &quot;Do you know I like this room most
of all in my baby house,&quot; added Meg, a minute after, as they went
upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.

Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and
exulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for
that linen closet was a joke.  You see, having said that if Meg married
&#39;that Brooke&#39; she shouldn&#39;t have a cent of her money, Aunt March was
rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her
repent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in
her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she
could satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence&#39;s mamma, was ordered to
buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,
and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the
secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt
March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could
give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first
bride.

&quot;That&#39;s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young
friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger
bowls for company and that satisfied her,&quot; said Mrs. March, patting the
damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their
fineness.

&quot;I haven&#39;t a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me
all my days, Hannah says.&quot;  And Meg looked quite contented, as well she
might.

A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt
basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a
great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the
gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...

&quot;Here I am, Mother!  Yes, it&#39;s all right.&quot;

The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a
kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the
little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.

&quot;For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker&#39;s congratulations and
compliments.  Bless you, Beth!  What a refreshing spectacle you are,
Jo.  Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.&quot;

As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled
Beth&#39;s hair ribbon, stared at Jo&#39;s big pinafore, and fell into an
attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and
everyone began to talk.

&quot;Where is John?&quot; asked Meg anxiously.

&quot;Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Which side won the last match, Teddy?&quot; inquired Jo, who persisted in
feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.

&quot;Ours, of course.  Wish you&#39;d been there to see.&quot;

&quot;How is the lovely Miss Randal?&quot; asked Amy with a significant smile.

&quot;More cruel than ever.  Don&#39;t you see how I&#39;m pining away?&quot; and Laurie
gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.

&quot;What&#39;s the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,&quot; said Beth, eying
the knobby parcel with curiosity.

&quot;It&#39;s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,&quot;
observed Laurie, as a watchman&#39;s rattle appeared, amid the laughter of
the girls.

&quot;Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just
swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood
in a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; and Laurie gave them a sample of
its powers that made them cover up their ears.

&quot;There&#39;s gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to
mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from
destruction.  I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she
hadn&#39;t defended it manfully I&#39;d have had a pick at it, for it looked
like a remarkably plummy one.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,&quot; said Meg in a matronly
tone.

&quot;I&#39;m doing my best, ma&#39;am, but can&#39;t get much higher, I&#39;m afraid, as
six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,&quot; responded
the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little
chandelier.

&quot;I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this
spick-and-span bower, so as I&#39;m tremendously hungry, I propose an
adjournment,&quot; he added presently.

&quot;Mother and I are going to wait for John.  There are some last things
to settle,&quot; said Meg, bustling away.

&quot;Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant&#39;s to get more flowers for
tomorrow,&quot; added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque
curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.

&quot;Come, Jo, don&#39;t desert a fellow.  I&#39;m in such a state of exhaustion I
can&#39;t get home without help.  Don&#39;t take off your apron, whatever you
do, it&#39;s peculiarly becoming,&quot; said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial
aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his
feeble steps.

&quot;Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,&quot; began Jo,
as they strolled away together.  &quot;You must promise to behave well, and
not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.&quot;

&quot;Not a prank.&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t say funny things when we ought to be sober.&quot;

&quot;I never do.  You are the one for that.&quot;

&quot;And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.  I shall
certainly laugh if you do.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t see me, you&#39;ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round
you will obscure the prospect.&quot;

&quot;I never cry unless for some great affliction.&quot;

&quot;Such as fellows going to college, hey?&quot; cut in Laurie, with suggestive
laugh.

&quot;Don&#39;t be a peacock.  I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.&quot;

&quot;Exactly.  I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?  Pretty amiable?&quot;

&quot;Very.  Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he&#39;ll take
it?&quot; asked Jo rather sharply.

&quot;Now, Jo, do you think I&#39;d look your mother in the face and say &#39;All
right&#39;, if it wasn&#39;t?&quot; and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,&quot; said
Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.

&quot;You spend a great deal, Teddy.&quot;

&quot;Bless you, I don&#39;t spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone
before I know it.&quot;

&quot;You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and
can&#39;t say &#39;No&#39; to anyone.  We heard about Henshaw and all you did for
him.  If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,&quot;
said Jo warmly.

&quot;Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.  You wouldn&#39;t have me let
that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help,
when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, but I don&#39;t see the use of your having seventeen
waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I
thought you&#39;d got over the dandy period, but every now and then it
breaks out in a new spot.  Just now it&#39;s the fashion to be hideous, to
make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,
orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.  If it was cheap
ugliness, I&#39;d say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I
don&#39;t get any satisfaction out of it.&quot;

Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,
that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only
afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and
stuffed it into his pocket.

&quot;Don&#39;t lecture any more, there&#39;s a good soul!  I have enough all
through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I&#39;ll get
myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my
friends.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you in peace if you&#39;ll only let your hair grow. I&#39;m not
aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks
like a young prize fighter,&quot; observed Jo severely.

&quot;This unassuming style promotes study, that&#39;s why we adopt it,&quot;
returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having
voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for
quarter-inch-long stubble.

&quot;By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate
about Amy.  He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about
in a most suspicious manner.  He&#39;d better nip his little passion in the
bud, hadn&#39;t he?&quot; added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,
after a minute&#39;s silence.

&quot;Of course he had.  We don&#39;t want any more marrying in this family for
years to come.  Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?&quot; and Jo
looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in
their teens.

&quot;It&#39;s a fast age, and I don&#39;t know what we are coming to, ma&#39;am. You
are a mere infant, but you&#39;ll go next, Jo, and we&#39;ll be left
lamenting,&quot; said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the
times.

&quot;Don&#39;t be alarmed.  I&#39;m not one of the agreeable sort.  Nobody will
want me, and it&#39;s a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a
family.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t give anyone a chance,&quot; said Laurie, with a sidelong glance
and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. &quot;You won&#39;t
show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it
by accident and can&#39;t help showing that he likes it, you treat him as
Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so
thorny no one dares touch or look at you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like that sort of thing.  I&#39;m too busy to be worried with
nonsense, and I think it&#39;s dreadful to break up families so. Now don&#39;t
say any more about it.  Meg&#39;s wedding has turned all our heads, and we
talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.  I don&#39;t wish to get
cross, so let&#39;s change the subject;&quot;  and Jo looked quite ready to
fling cold water on the slightest provocation.

Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in
a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the
gate, &quot;Mark my words, Jo, you&#39;ll go next.&quot;



CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

THE FIRST WEDDING

The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that
morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,
like friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with
excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,
whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the
dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod
and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a
welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,
and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest
baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle
mistress who had loved and tended them so long.

Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest
in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it
fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,
lace, nor orange flowers would she have.  &quot;I don&#39;t want a fashionable
wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to
look and be my familiar self.&quot;

So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes
and innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her
pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the
valley, which &#39;her John&#39; liked best of all the flowers that grew.

&quot;You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely
that I should hug you if it wouldn&#39;t crumple your dress,&quot; cried Amy,
surveying her with delight when all was done.

&quot;Then I am satisfied.  But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don&#39;t
mind my dress.  I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it
today,&quot;  and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her
with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not
changed the old.

&quot;Now I&#39;m going to tie John&#39;s cravat for him, and then to stay a few
minutes with Father quietly in the study,&quot;  and Meg ran down to perform
these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she
went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there
was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the
first bird from the nest.

As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their
simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which
three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their
best just now.

Jo&#39;s angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with
ease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,
more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a
fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only
gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.

Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,
kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,
although it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches
the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains
and always speaks hopefully of &#39;being better soon&#39;.

Amy is with truth considered &#39;the flower of the family&#39;, for at sixteen
she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but
possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the
lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her
dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as
attractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy&#39;s nose still afflicted her,
for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and
having a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her
whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her
wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and
abundant than ever.

All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the
summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just
what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in
their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the
romance of womanhood.

There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as
natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was
scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in,
to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and
to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a
grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.

&quot;Upon my word, here&#39;s a state of things!&quot; cried the old lady, taking
the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her
lavender moire with a great rustle.  &quot;You oughtn&#39;t to be seen till the
last minute, child.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to
criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.  I&#39;m too happy to
care what anyone says or thinks, and I&#39;m going to have my little
wedding just as I like it.  John, dear, here&#39;s your hammer.&quot;  And away
went Meg to help &#39;that man&#39; in his highly improper employment.

Mr. Brooke didn&#39;t even say, &quot;Thank you,&quot; but as he stooped for the
unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,
with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with
a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.

A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous
exclamation, &quot;Jupiter Ammon!  Jo&#39;s upset the cake again!&quot; caused a
momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins
arrived, and &#39;the party came in&#39;, as Beth used to say when a child.

&quot;Don&#39;t let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than
mosquitoes,&quot; whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and
Laurie&#39;s black head towered above the rest.

&quot;He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant
if he likes,&quot; returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware
of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a
devotion that nearly distracted her.

There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room
as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green
arch.  Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.
The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the
service more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom&#39;s hand trembled
visibly, and no one heard his replies.  But Meg looked straight up in
her husband&#39;s eyes, and said, &quot;I will!&quot; with such tender trust in her
own face and voice that her mother&#39;s heart rejoiced and Aunt March
sniffed audibly.

Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved
from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring
fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his
wicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother&#39;s shoulder,
but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of
sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.

It wasn&#39;t at all the thing, I&#39;m afraid, but the minute she was fairly
married, Meg cried, &quot;The first kiss for Marmee!&quot; and turning, gave it
with her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked
more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their
privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,
adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her
in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, &quot;Bless you, deary, a
hundred times!  The cake ain&#39;t hurt a mite, and everything looks
lovely.&quot;

Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried
to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are
light.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the
little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful
lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt
March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and
coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes
carried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on
serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his
hand and a puzzled expression on his face.

&quot;Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?&quot; he whispered, &quot;or am I
merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this
morning?&quot;

&quot;No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March
actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and
dispatched the rest to the Soldier&#39;s Home.  You know he thinks that
wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she
nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.&quot;

Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he
did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous
way, &quot;I like that!  For I&#39;ve seen enough harm done to wish other women
would think as you do.&quot;

&quot;You are not made wise by experience, I hope?&quot; and there was an anxious
accent in Meg&#39;s voice.

&quot;No.  I give you my word for it.  Don&#39;t think too well of me, either,
this is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as
common as water and almost as harmless, I don&#39;t care for it, but when a
pretty girl offers it, one doesn&#39;t like to refuse, you see.&quot;

&quot;But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,
Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest
day of my life.&quot;

A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,
for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if
he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her
power, used it as a woman may for her friend&#39;s good. She did not speak,
but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,
and a smile which said, &quot;No one can refuse me anything today.&quot;

Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her
his hand, saying heartily, &quot;I promise, Mrs. Brooke!&quot;

&quot;I thank you, very, very much.&quot;

&quot;And I drink &#39;long life to your resolution&#39;, Teddy,&quot; cried Jo,
baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and
beamed approvingly upon him.

So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of
many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy
moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his
life.

After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the
house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and
John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,
when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing
touch to this unfashionable wedding.

&quot;All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband
and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in
couples outside!&quot; cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,
with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their
example without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol
began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a
moment&#39;s hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into
the ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for
when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,
she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join
hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young
folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.

Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people
began to go.

&quot;I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you&#39;ll
be sorry for it,&quot; said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as
he led her to the carriage, &quot;You&#39;ve got a treasure, young man, see that
you deserve it.&quot;

&quot;That is the prettiest wedding I&#39;ve been to for an age, Ned, and I
don&#39;t see why, for there wasn&#39;t a bit of style about it,&quot; observed Mrs.
Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.

&quot;Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get
one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly
satisfied,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to
rest after the excitement of the morning.

&quot;I&#39;ll do my best to gratify you, Sir,&quot; was Laurie&#39;s unusually dutiful
reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.

The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had
was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she
came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and
straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say
&#39;good-by&#39;, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.

&quot;Don&#39;t feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love
you any the less for loving John so much,&quot; she said, clinging to her
mother, with full eyes for a moment.  &quot;I shall come every day, Father,
and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am
married.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls
will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank
you all for my happy wedding day.  Good-by, good-by!&quot;

They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender
pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband&#39;s arm, with her hands
full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face--and
so Meg&#39;s married life began.



CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS

It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and
genius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning
this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for
inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.
For a long time there was a lull in the &#39;mud-pie&#39; business, and she
devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed
such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant
and profitable.  But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid
aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,
the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of
burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic
and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about
promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and
the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.  Raphael&#39;s face was found
boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on
the head of a beer barrel.  A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the
sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied
kindling for some time.

From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy
fell to painting with undiminished ardor.  An artist friend fitted her
out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed
away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on
land or sea.  Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken
prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her
vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,
if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging
had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.  Swarthy boys
and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,
suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in
the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,
Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange
lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash
in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor&#39;s shirt or a
king&#39;s robe, as the spectator pleased.

Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,
looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened
into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,
and Amy&#39;s hair, Jo&#39;s nose, Meg&#39;s mouth, and Laurie&#39;s eyes were
pronounced &#39;wonderfully fine&#39;.  A return to clay and plaster followed,
and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or
tumbled off closet shelves onto people&#39;s heads.  Children were enticed
in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings
caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress.  Her
efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an
untoward accident, which quenched her ardor.  Other models failing her
for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family
were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running
to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed
with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened
with unexpected rapidity.  With much difficulty and some danger she was
dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that
her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial
of one artistic attempt, at least.

After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her
to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and
sighing for ruins to copy.  She caught endless colds sitting on damp
grass to book &#39;a delicious bit&#39;, composed of a stone, a stump, one
mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or &#39;a heavenly mass of clouds&#39;,
that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She
sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to
study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after
&#39;points of sight&#39;, or whatever the squint-and-string performance is
called.

If &#39;genius is eternal patience&#39;, as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some
claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all
obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time
she should do something worthy to be called &#39;high art&#39;.

She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she
had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she
never became a great artist.  Here she succeeded better, for she was
one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make
friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less
fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky
star.  Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.  She had
an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the
right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and
place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, &quot;If Amy
went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she&#39;d know exactly what
to do.&quot;

One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in &#39;our best society&#39;,
without being quite sure what the best really was.  Money, position,
fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable
things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed
them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not
admirable.  Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she
cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the
opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which
poverty now excluded her.

&quot;My lady,&quot; as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine
lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy
refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and
that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.

&quot;I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,&quot; Amy said, coming in with an
important air one day.

&quot;Well, little girl, what is it?&quot; replied her mother, in whose eyes the
stately young lady still remained &#39;the baby&#39;.

&quot;Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate
for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.  They are wild
to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things
they admire in my book.  They have been very kind to me in many ways,
and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they
never made any difference.&quot;

&quot;Why should they?&quot; and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls
called her &#39;Maria Theresa air&#39;.

&quot;You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly
everyone, so don&#39;t ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your
chickens get pecked by smarter birds.  The ugly duckling turned out a
swan, you know.&quot;  and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed
a happy temper and hopeful spirit.

Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,
&quot;Well, my swan, what is your plan?&quot;

&quot;I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them
for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,
perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.&quot;

&quot;That looks feasible.  What do you want for lunch?  Cake, sandwiches,
fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear, no!  We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate
and ice cream, besides.  The girls are used to such things, and I want
my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.&quot;

&quot;How many young ladies are there?&quot; asked her mother, beginning to look
sober.

&quot;Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won&#39;t all come.&quot;

&quot;Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them
about.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?  Not more than six or
eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr.
Laurence&#39;s cherry-bounce.&quot; (Hannah&#39;s pronunciation of char-a-banc.)

&quot;All of this will be expensive, Amy.&quot;

&quot;Not very.  I&#39;ve calculated the cost, and I&#39;ll pay for it myself.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,
and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan
would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much
better for us than buying or borrowing what we don&#39;t need, and
attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?&quot;

&quot;If I can&#39;t have it as I like, I don&#39;t care to have it at all. I know
that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help
a little, and I don&#39;t see why I can&#39;t if I&#39;m willing to pay for it,&quot;
said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
obstinacy.

Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it
was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she
would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking
advice as much as they did salts and senna.

&quot;Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way
through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I&#39;ll
say no more.  Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you
decide, I&#39;ll do my best to help you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.&quot; and away went Amy to lay her
plan before her sisters.

Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she
possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons.
But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with
it at first.

&quot;Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and
turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don&#39;t care a
sixpence for you?  I thought you had too much pride and sense to
truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and
rides in a coupe,&quot; said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of
her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.

&quot;I don&#39;t truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!&quot;
returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions
arose. &quot;The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there&#39;s a great
deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you
call fashionable nonsense.  You don&#39;t care to make people like you, to
go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and
I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through
the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it
independence, if you like.  That&#39;s not my way.&quot;

When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the
best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,
while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to
such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an
argument.  Amy&#39;s definition of Jo&#39;s idea of independence was such a
good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more
amiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to
sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she
regarded as &#39;a nonsensical business&#39;.

The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following
Monday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor
because her week&#39;s work was deranged, and prophesied that &quot;ef the
washin&#39; and ironin&#39; warn&#39;t done reg&#39;lar, nothin&#39; would go well
anywheres&quot;.  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had
a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy&#39;s motto was &#39;Nil
desperandum&#39;, and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to
do it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah&#39;s cooking
didn&#39;t turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and
the chocolate wouldn&#39;t froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more
than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which
seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.
Beth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of
callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind
that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,
serious, and trying.

If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,
an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On
Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more
exasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,
blew a little, and didn&#39;t make up its mind till it was too late for
anyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out
of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got
in order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but
without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the
best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the
carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave
an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo
scattered about.

The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped
it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver
would get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and
Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah
behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an
absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of
everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy
cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch
safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of
artistic delights, for the &#39;cherry bounce&#39; and the broken bridge were
her strong points.

Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor
to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart
shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young
ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the
exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the
perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.

&quot;No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must
fly round and be ready for them,&quot; said Amy, as the sun woke her next
morning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had
said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting
a little stale.

&quot;I can&#39;t get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,&quot;
said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of
placid despair.

&quot;Use the chicken then, the toughness won&#39;t matter in a salad,&quot; advised
his wife.

&quot;Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at
it.  I&#39;m very sorry, Amy,&quot; added Beth, who was still a patroness of
cats.

&quot;Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won&#39;t do,&quot; said Amy
decidedly.

&quot;Shall I rush into town and demand one?&quot; asked Jo, with the magnanimity
of a martyr.

&quot;You&#39;d come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to
try me.  I&#39;ll go myself,&quot; answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to
fail.

Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she
departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and
fit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her
desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further
loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her
own forethought.

As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,
Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to
find out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her
card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,
who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,
&quot;Good morning, Miss March,&quot; and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie&#39;s
most elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out
before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and
congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,
returned the young man&#39;s greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.

They got on excellently, for Amy&#39;s chief care was soon set at rest by
learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting
away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In
stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the
lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the
highborn eyes of a Tudor!

&quot;By Jove, she&#39;s forgotten her dinner!&quot; cried the unconscious youth,
poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing
to hand out the basket after the old lady.

&quot;Please don&#39;t--it&#39;s--it&#39;s mine,&quot; murmured Amy, with a face nearly as
red as her fish.

&quot;Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It&#39;s an uncommonly fine one, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest
that did credit to his breeding.

Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,
and said, laughing, &quot;Don&#39;t you wish you were to have some of the salad
he&#39;s going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat
it?&quot;

Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind
were touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of
pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about &#39;the charming young ladies&#39;
diverted his mind from the comical mishap.

&quot;I suppose he&#39;ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan&#39;t see
them, that&#39;s a comfort,&quot; thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.

She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,
thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of
dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the
preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve
o&#39;clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were
interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of
yesterday&#39;s failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the
&#39;cherry bounce&#39;, and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests
to the banquet.

&quot;There&#39;s the rumble, they&#39;re coming!  I&#39;ll go onto the porch and meet
them.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good
time after all her trouble,&quot; said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the
word.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable
expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one
young lady.

&quot;Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It
will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,&quot;
cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even
for a laugh.

In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who
had kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic
turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a
most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the
merriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily
partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with
enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),
and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when
&#39;the party went out&#39;.

As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she
observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,
except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo&#39;s mouth.

&quot;You&#39;ve had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,&quot; said her mother,
as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.

&quot;Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I
thought,&quot; observed Beth, with unusual warmth.

&quot;Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so
much company, and I can&#39;t make such delicious stuff as yours,&quot; asked
Meg soberly.

&quot;Take it all.  I&#39;m the only one here who likes sweet things, and it
will mold before I can dispose of it,&quot; answered Amy, thinking with a
sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.

&quot;It&#39;s a pity Laurie isn&#39;t here to help us,&quot; began Jo, as they sat down
to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.

A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the
whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,
&quot;salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...&quot;
Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the &#39;history of salads&#39;,
to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.

&quot;Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.  Germans
like messes.  I&#39;m sick of the sight of this, and there&#39;s no reason you
should all die of a surfeit because I&#39;ve been a fool,&quot; cried Amy,
wiping her eyes.

&quot;I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about
in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big
nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,&quot; sighed
Jo, quite spent with laughter.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to
satisfy you,&quot; said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.

&quot;I am satisfied.  I&#39;ve done what I undertook, and it&#39;s not my fault
that it failed.  I comfort myself with that,&quot; said Amy with a little
quiver in her voice.  &quot;I thank you all very much for helping me, and
I&#39;ll thank you still more if you won&#39;t allude to it for a month, at
least.&quot;

No one did for several months, but the word &#39;fete&#39; always produced a
general smile, and Laurie&#39;s birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral
lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.



CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

LITERARY LESSONS

Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her
path.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would
have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her
in this wise.

Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her
scribbling suit, and &#39;fall into a vortex&#39;, as she expressed it, writing
away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was
finished she could find no peace.  Her &#39;scribbling suit&#39; consisted of a
black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a
cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which
she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action.  This cap
was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these
periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads
semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, &quot;Does genius burn, Jo?&quot; They
did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an
observation of the cap, and judged accordingly.  If this expressive
article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that
hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly
askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,
and cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,
and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,
did anyone dare address Jo.

She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing
fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a
blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat
safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real
and dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals
stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness
which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth
living, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually
lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her &#39;vortex&#39;, hungry,
sleepy, cross, or despondent.

She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was
prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for
her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People&#39;s Course, the
lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a
subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great
social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding
the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy
with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying
to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.

They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking,
Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the
seat with them.  On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads
and bonnets to match, discussing Women&#39;s Rights and making tatting.
Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the
hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an
old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna.  On
her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a
newspaper.

It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,
idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed
the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,
tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two
infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,
were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying
away in the background with her mouth wide open.  Pausing to turn a
page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half
his paper, saying bluntly, &quot;want to read it? That&#39;s a first-rate story.&quot;

Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for
lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,
mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light
literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author&#39;s
invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the
dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.

&quot;Prime, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked the boy, as her eye went down the last
paragraph of her portion.

&quot;I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,&quot; returned Jo,
amused at his admiration of the trash.

&quot;I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.  She makes a good
living out of such stories, they say.&quot; and he pointed to the name of
Mrs. S.L.A.N.G.  Northbury, under the title of the tale.

&quot;Do you know her?&quot; asked Jo, with sudden interest.

&quot;No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the
office where this paper is printed.&quot;

&quot;Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?&quot; and Jo
looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled
exclamation points that adorned the page.

&quot;Guess she does!  She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well
for writing it.&quot;

Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while
Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and
hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,
and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its
columns for a sensational story.  By the time the lecture ended and the
audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not
the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of
her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before
the elopement or after the murder.

She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much
to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when
&#39;genius took to burning&#39;.  Jo had never tried this style before,
contenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her
experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave
her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and
costumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her
limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to
make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an
earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript
was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that
if the tale didn&#39;t get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,
she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.

Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to
keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all
hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred
dollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had
been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the
amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what
intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would
devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo
valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and
after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned
to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.

A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed
herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the
letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won
the prize.  Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story
came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her
that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the
tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly
way...

&quot;You can do better than this, Jo.  Aim at the highest, and never mind
the money.&quot;

&quot;I think the money is the best part of it.  What will you do with such
a fortune?&quot; asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a
reverential eye.

&quot;Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,&quot; answered Jo
promptly.

To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn&#39;t
come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,
while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was
satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with
a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She
did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the
house, for by the magic of a pen, her &#39;rubbish&#39; turned into comforts
for them all.  The Duke&#39;s Daughter paid the butcher&#39;s bill, A Phantom
Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the
blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.

Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny
side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine
satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the
inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful
blessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and
ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that
she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.

Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and
encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame
and fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to
all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling
to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she
would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she
particularly admired.

&quot;Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for
printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can
for it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is
more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this
important subject,&quot; said Jo, calling a family council.

&quot;Don&#39;t spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,
and the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,&quot; was her
father&#39;s advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited
patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no
haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.

&quot;It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by
waiting,&quot; said Mrs. March.  &quot;Criticism is the best test of such work,
for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her
to do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame
of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jo, knitting her brows, &quot;that&#39;s just it.  I&#39;ve been fussing
over the thing so long, I really don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s good, bad, or
indifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons
take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t leave a word out of it.  You&#39;ll spoil it if you do, for the
interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the
people, and it will be all a muddle if you don&#39;t explain as you go on,&quot;
said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable
novel ever written.

&quot;But Mr. Allen says, &#39;Leave out the explanations, make it brief and
dramatic, and let the characters tell the story&#39;,&quot; interrupted Jo,
turning to the publisher&#39;s note.

&quot;Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don&#39;t. Make a
good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when
you&#39;ve got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical
and metaphysical people in your novels,&quot; said Amy, who took a strictly
practical view of the subject.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Jo, laughing, &quot;if my people are &#39;philosophical and
metaphysical&#39;, it isn&#39;t my fault, for I know nothing about such things,
except what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I&#39;ve got some of his wise
ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,
Beth, what do you say?&quot;

&quot;I should so like to see it printed soon,&quot; was all Beth said, and
smiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last
word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike
candor, which chilled Jo&#39;s heart for a minute with a forboding fear,
and decided her to make her little venture &#39;soon&#39;.

So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on
her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of
pleasing everyone, she took everyone&#39;s advice, and like the old man and
his donkey in the fable suited nobody.

Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got
into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about
it.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.
Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.
Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while
Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo
quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the
story.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and
confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into
the big, busy world to try its fate.

Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,
likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she
expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it
took her some time to recover.

&quot;You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when
it&#39;s so contradictory that I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;ve written a
promising book or broken all the ten commandments?&quot; cried poor Jo,
turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with
pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  &quot;This man says,
&#39;An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.&#39; &#39;All is
sweet, pure, and healthy.&#39;&quot; continued the perplexed authoress.  &quot;The
next, &#39;The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,
spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.&#39; Now, as I had no
theory of any kind, don&#39;t believe in Spiritualism, and copied my
characters from life, I don&#39;t see how this critic can be right.
Another says, &#39;It&#39;s one of the best American novels which has appeared
for years.&#39; (I know better than that), and the next asserts that
&#39;Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is
a dangerous book.&#39; &#39;Tisn&#39;t!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and
nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only
wrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I&#39;d printed the whole
or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.&quot;

Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.
Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so
well and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those
whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an
author&#39;s best education, and when the first soreness was over, she
could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel
herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.

&quot;Not being a genius, like Keats, it won&#39;t kill me,&quot; she said stoutly,
&quot;and I&#39;ve got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were
taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,
and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced
&#39;charmingly natural, tender, and true&#39;.  So I&#39;ll comfort myself with
that, and when I&#39;m ready, I&#39;ll up again and take another.&quot;



CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES

Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the
determination to be a model housekeeper.  John should find home a
paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously
every day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much
love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but
succeed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil
one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and
bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was
too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course
of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,
she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the
carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,
and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better
than hers.

They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn&#39;t
live on love alone.  John did not find Meg&#39;s beauty diminished, though
she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg
miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband
followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, &quot;Shall I send some veal
or mutton for dinner, darling?&quot; The little house ceased to be a
glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt
that it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,
and frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to
business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,
and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to
work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.

While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius&#39;s
Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the
problems with patience and care.  Sometimes her family were invited in
to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be
privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be
concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little
Hummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced
a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would
ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread
pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although
he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was
found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young
couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.

Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with
homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John
was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra
quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be
attended to at once.  As John firmly believed that &#39;my wife&#39; was equal
to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that
she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most
pleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little
pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for
her.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the
elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the
bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her
success, for hadn&#39;t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array
of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and
the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg
resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,
straining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked
advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah
did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but
that dreadful stuff wouldn&#39;t &#39;jell&#39;.

She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,
but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with
their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over
that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,
but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on
without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had
advised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats
all that hot summer day, and at five o&#39;clock sat down in her
topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and
wept.

Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, &quot;My
husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he
likes.  I shall always be prepared.  There shall be no flurry, no
scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good
dinner.  John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you
please, and be sure of a welcome from me.&quot;

How charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to
hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a
superior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,
it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an
opportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in
this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which
we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.

If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have
been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the
year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.  Congratulating
himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling
sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant
anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty
wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his
mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and
husband.

It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached
the Dovecote.  The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was
not only shut, but locked, and yesterday&#39;s mud still adorned the steps.
The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty
wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in
her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she
greeted her guest.  Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a
sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid something has happened.  Step into the garden, Scott, while
I look up Mrs. Brooke,&quot; said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.

Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and
Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face.  He paused
discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see
and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.

In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.  One edition of jelly was
trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was
burning gaily on the stove.  Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly
eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly
liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat
sobbing dismally.

&quot;My dearest girl, what is the matter?&quot; cried John, rushing in, with
awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret
consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.

&quot;Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!  I&#39;ve been at
it till I&#39;m all worn out.  Do come and help me or I shall die!&quot; and the
exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet
welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized
at the same time as the floor.

&quot;What worries you dear?  Has anything dreadful happened?&quot; asked the
anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was
all askew.

&quot;Yes,&quot; sobbed Meg despairingly.

&quot;Tell me quick, then.  Don&#39;t cry.  I can bear anything better than
that.  Out with it, love.&quot;

&quot;The... The jelly won&#39;t jell and I don&#39;t know what to do!&quot;

John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the
derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which
put the finishing stroke to poor Meg&#39;s woe.

&quot;Is that all?  Fling it out of the window, and don&#39;t bother any more
about it.  I&#39;ll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven&#39;s sake
don&#39;t have hysterics, for I&#39;ve brought Jack Scott home to dinner,
and...&quot;

John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a
tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of
mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...

&quot;A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!  John Brooke, how could you
do such a thing?&quot;

&quot;Hush, he&#39;s in the garden!  I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can&#39;t
be helped now,&quot; said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.

&quot;You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to
have remembered how busy I was,&quot; continued Meg petulantly, for even
turtledoves will peck when ruffled.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for
I met him on the way out.  I never thought of asking leave, when you
have always told me to do as I liked.  I never tried it before, and
hang me if I ever do again!&quot; added John, with an aggrieved air.

&quot;I should hope not!  Take him away at once.  I can&#39;t see him, and there
isn&#39;t any dinner.&quot;

&quot;Well, I like that!  Where&#39;s the beef and vegetables I sent home, and
the pudding you promised?&quot; cried John, rushing to the larder.

&quot;I hadn&#39;t time to cook anything.  I meant to dine at Mother&#39;s. I&#39;m
sorry, but I was so busy,&quot; and Meg&#39;s tears began again.

John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day&#39;s work to
come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty
table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or
manner.  He restrained himself however, and the little squall would
have blown over, but for one unlucky word.

&quot;It&#39;s a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we&#39;ll pull
through and have a good time yet.  Don&#39;t cry, dear, but just exert
yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We&#39;re both as hungry
as hunters, so we shan&#39;t mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and
bread and cheese.  We won&#39;t ask for jelly.&quot;

He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his
fate.  Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and
the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.

&quot;You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I&#39;m too used up
to &#39;exert&#39; myself for anyone.  It&#39;s like a man to propose a bone and
vulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won&#39;t have anything of the sort
in my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother&#39;s, and tell him I&#39;m away,
sick, dead, anything.  I won&#39;t see him, and you two can laugh at me and
my jelly as much as you like.  You won&#39;t have anything else here.&quot;  and
having delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her
pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own
room.

What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.
Scott was not taken &#39;up to Mother&#39;s&#39;, and when Meg descended, after
they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous
lunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten
&quot;a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the
sweet stuff, and hide the pots.&quot;

Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own
short-comings, of loyalty to John, &quot;who might be cruel, but nobody
should know it,&quot; restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she
dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be
forgiven.

Unfortunately, John didn&#39;t come, not seeing the matter in that light.
He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little
wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his
friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but
John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had
deserted him in his hour of need.  &quot;It wasn&#39;t fair to tell a man to
bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you
at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to
be laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn&#39;t! And Meg must know
it.&quot;

He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over
and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over
him.  &quot;Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so
heartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was
young.  I must be patient and teach her.&quot;  He hoped she had not gone
home--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled
again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry
herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,
resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where
she had failed in her duty to her spouse.

Meg likewise resolved to be &#39;calm and kind, but firm&#39;, and show him his
duty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and
comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of
the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,
as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.

John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling
that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came
leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly
relevant remark, &quot;We are going to have a new moon, my dear.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve no objection,&quot; was Meg&#39;s equally soothing remark.  A few other
topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and
wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went
to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,
figuratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if
new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither
spoke.  Both looked quite &#39;calm and firm&#39;, and both felt desperately
uncomfortable.

&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; thought Meg, &quot;married life is very trying, and does need
infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.&quot;  The word &#39;Mother&#39;
suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with
unbelieving protests.

&quot;John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see
and bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but
never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.
He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,
though you call him &#39;fussy&#39;. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,
and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.
He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the
white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to
quench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against
yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch
yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against
the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave
the way for bitter sorrow and regret.&quot;

These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,
especially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own
hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her
own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to
such a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in
her eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,
thinking, &quot;I will be the first to say, &#39;Forgive me&#39;&quot;, but he did not
seem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was
hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a
minute she felt as if she really couldn&#39;t do it, then came the thought,
&quot;This is the beginning. I&#39;ll do my part, and have nothing to reproach
myself with,&quot; and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the
forehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than
a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying
tenderly...

&quot;It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,
dear.  I never will again!&quot;

But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both
declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family
peace was preserved in that little family jar.

After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and
served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first
course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made
everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a
lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all
the way home.

In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat
renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at
the little house, or inviting &#39;that poor dear&#39; to come in and spend the
day at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often
felt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and
nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell
out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.
Seeing Sallie&#39;s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself
because she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered
her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John
wouldn&#39;t like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what
John disliked even worse.

She knew her husband&#39;s income, and she loved to feel that he trusted
her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value
more--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she
liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every
penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man&#39;s
wife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her
little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without
fear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg&#39;s paradise, and tempted
her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg
didn&#39;t like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but
she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console
herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn&#39;t think she
had to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty
things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn&#39;t
worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in
the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.

But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up
her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.
John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he
was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg
never forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and
it weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg
longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black
silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper
for girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of
twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year&#39;s.  That was only a month to
wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had
the money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his
was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective
five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?
That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to
lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg
beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,
shimmering folds, and said, &quot;A bargain, I assure, you, ma&#39;am.&quot; She
answered, &quot;I&#39;ll take it,&quot; and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie
had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no
consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,
and the police were after her.

When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by
spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn&#39;t
become her, after all, and the words &#39;fifty dollars&#39; seemed stamped
like a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,
not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost
of a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that
night, Meg&#39;s heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,
she was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they
could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had
found her out, but didn&#39;t mean to let her know it.  The house bills
were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was
undoing the old pocketbook which they called the &#39;bank&#39;, when Meg,
knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...

&quot;You haven&#39;t seen my private expense book yet.&quot;

John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,
and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women
wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning
of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three
rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a
bonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like
the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her
extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent
wife.

The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg
got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of
his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic
increasing with every word...

&quot;John, dear, I&#39;m ashamed to show you my book, for I&#39;ve really been
dreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,
you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year&#39;s
money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for
I knew you&#39;d think it wrong in me.&quot;

John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,
&quot;Don&#39;t go and hide.  I won&#39;t beat you if you have got a pair of killing
boots.  I&#39;m rather proud of my wife&#39;s feet, and don&#39;t mind if she does
pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.&quot;

That had been one of her last &#39;trifles&#39;, and John&#39;s eye had fallen on
it as he spoke.  &quot;Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful
fifty dollars!&quot; thought Meg, with a shiver.

&quot;It&#39;s worse than boots, it&#39;s a silk dress,&quot; she said, with the calmness
of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.

&quot;Well, dear, what is the &#39;dem&#39;d total&#39;, as Mr. Mantalini says?&quot;

That didn&#39;t sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with
the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and
answer with one as frank till now.  She turned the page and her head at
the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough
without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For
a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she could
feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure--. . .

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the
furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t made or trimmed,&quot; sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden
recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.

&quot;Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,
but I&#39;ve no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat&#39;s when she
gets it on,&quot; said John dryly.

&quot;I know you are angry, John, but I can&#39;t help it.  I don&#39;t mean to
waste your money, and I didn&#39;t think those little things would count up
so.  I can&#39;t resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and
pitying me because I don&#39;t.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and
I&#39;m tired of being poor.&quot;

The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but
he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many
pleasures for Meg&#39;s sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the
minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,
saying with a little quiver in his voice, &quot;I was afraid of this.  I do
my best, Meg.&quot;  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not
have broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held
him close, crying, with repentant tears, &quot;Oh, John, my dear, kind,
hard-working boy.  I didn&#39;t mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and
ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!&quot;

He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,
but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be
forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had
promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had
reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings
recklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so
quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he
stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry
herself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the
discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat
reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had
simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, &quot;I
can&#39;t afford it, my dear.&quot;

Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with
her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would
break.

They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband
better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,
given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him
a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings
and failures of those he loved.

Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the
truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.
Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present
of it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and
when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new
silk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his
present, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home
early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning
by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted
little wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to
Meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman&#39;s life.

Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,
with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for
Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the
other.

&quot;How&#39;s the little mamma?  Where is everybody?  Why didn&#39;t you tell me
before I came home?&quot; began Laurie in a loud whisper.

&quot;Happy as a queen, the dear!  Every soul of &#39;em is upstairs a
worshipin&#39;.  We didn&#39;t want no hurrycanes round.  Now you go into the
parlor, and I&#39;ll send &#39;em down to you,&quot; with which somewhat involved
reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.

Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon
a large pillow.  Jo&#39;s face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and
there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.

&quot;Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,&quot; she said invitingly.

Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him
with an imploring gesture.  &quot;No, thank you.  I&#39;d rather not.  I shall
drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.&quot;

&quot;Then you shan&#39;t see your nevvy,&quot; said Jo decidedly, turning as if to
go.

&quot;I will, I will!  Only you must be responsible for damages.&quot; and
obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put
into his arms.  A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,
and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself
invested with two babies instead of one.

No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough
to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the
unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that
Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.

&quot;Twins, by Jupiter!&quot; was all he said for a minute, then turning to the
women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added,
&quot;Take &#39;em quick, somebody!  I&#39;m going to laugh, and I shall drop &#39;em.&quot;

Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,
as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie
laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.

&quot;It&#39;s the best joke of the season, isn&#39;t it?  I wouldn&#39;t have told you,
for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I&#39;ve done
it,&quot; said Jo, when she got her breath.

&quot;I never was more staggered in my life.  Isn&#39;t it fun?  Are they boys?
What are you going to name them? Let&#39;s have another look.  Hold me up,
Jo, for upon my life it&#39;s one too many for me,&quot; returned Laurie,
regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland
looking at a pair of infantile kittens.

&quot;Boy and girl.  Aren&#39;t they beauties?&quot; said the proud papa, beaming
upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.

&quot;Most remarkable children I ever saw.  Which is which?&quot; and Laurie bent
like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.

&quot;Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French
fashion, so you can always tell.  Besides, one has blue eyes and one
brown.  Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,&quot; said wicked Jo.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid they mightn&#39;t like it,&quot; began Laurie, with unusual timidity
in such matters.

&quot;Of course they will, they are used to it now.  Do it this minute,
sir!&quot; commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.

Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each
little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.

&quot;There, I knew they didn&#39;t like it!  That&#39;s the boy, see him kick, he
hits out with his fists like a good one.  Now then, young Brooke, pitch
into a man of your own size, will you?&quot; cried Laurie, delighted with a
poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.

&quot;He&#39;s to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother
and grandmother.  We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs,
and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,&quot;
said Amy, with aunt-like interest.

&quot;Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,&quot; said Laurie.

&quot;Daisy and Demi, just the thing!  I knew Teddy would do it,&quot; cried Jo
clapping her hands.

Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were &#39;Daisy&#39; and
&#39;Demi&#39; to the end of the chapter.



CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

CALLS

&quot;Come, Jo, it&#39;s time.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make
half a dozen calls with me today?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don&#39;t
think I ever was mad enough to say I&#39;d make six calls in one day, when
a single one upsets me for a week.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.  I was to finish the crayon
of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our
neighbors&#39; visits.&quot;

&quot;If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my
bond, Shylock.  There is a pile of clouds in the east, it&#39;s not fair,
and I don&#39;t go.&quot;

&quot;Now, that&#39;s shirking.  It&#39;s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you
pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your
duty, and then be at peace for another six months.&quot;

At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was
mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself
because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking
to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make
calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the
formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,
bribe, or promise.  In the present instance there was no escape, and
having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she
smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat
and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.

&quot;Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!  You don&#39;t
intend to make calls in that state, I hope,&quot; cried Amy, surveying her
with amazement.

&quot;Why not?  I&#39;m neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty
walk on a warm day.  If people care more for my clothes than they do
for me, I don&#39;t wish to see them.  You can dress for both, and be as
elegant as you please.  It pays for you to be fine.  It doesn&#39;t for me,
and furbelows only worry me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Amy, &quot;now she&#39;s in a contrary fit, and will drive me
distracted before I can get her properly ready. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no
pleasure to me to go today, but it&#39;s a debt we owe society, and there&#39;s
no one to pay it but you and me.  I&#39;ll do anything for you, Jo, if
you&#39;ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil.
You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and
behave so beautifully, if you try, that I&#39;m proud of you.  I&#39;m afraid
to go alone, do come and take care of me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old
sister in that way.  The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred,
and your being afraid to go anywhere alone!  I don&#39;t know which is the
most absurd.  Well, I&#39;ll go if I must, and do my best.  You shall be
commander of the expedition, and I&#39;ll obey blindly, will that satisfy
you?&quot; said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike
submission.

&quot;You&#39;re a perfect cherub!  Now put on all your best things, and I&#39;ll
tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good
impression.  I want people to like you, and they would if you&#39;d only
try to be a little more agreeable.  Do your hair the pretty way, and
put the pink rose in your bonnet.  It&#39;s becoming, and you look too
sober in your plain suit.  Take your light gloves and the embroidered
handkerchief.  We&#39;ll stop at Meg&#39;s, and borrow her white sunshade, and
then you can have my dove-colored one.&quot;

While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not
without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled
into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet
strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she
put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out
the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the
present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her
hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last
touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of
countenance, saying meekly...

&quot;I&#39;m perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die
happy.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re highly satisfactory.  Turn slowly round, and let me get a
careful view.&quot; Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then
fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, &quot;Yes,
you&#39;ll do.  Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with
the rose is quite ravishing.  Hold back your shoulders, and carry your
hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.  There&#39;s one thing you
can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can&#39;t, but it&#39;s very nice to
see you, and I&#39;m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one.  It&#39;s
simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.
Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress
evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose
isn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,&quot; said Jo, looking through
her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the
golden hair.  &quot;Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it
up, please, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house.  The sweeping
style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts
gracefully.  You haven&#39;t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once.  You&#39;ll
never look finished if you are not careful about the little details,
for they make up the pleasing whole.&quot;

Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing
up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as
&#39;pretty as picters&#39;, Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window
to watch them.

&quot;Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so
I want you to put on your best deportment.  Don&#39;t make any of your
abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?  Just be calm, cool, and
quiet, that&#39;s safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen
minutes,&quot; said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed
the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.

&quot;Let me see.  &#39;Calm, cool, and quiet&#39;, yes, I think I can promise that.
I&#39;ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I&#39;ll try it
off.  My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind,
my child.&quot;

Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during
the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold
correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as
silent as the sphinx.  In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her &#39;charming
novel&#39;, and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,
and the fashions.  Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a
demure &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; with the chill on.  In vain Amy telegraphed the
word &#39;talk&#39;, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with
her foot.  Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment
like Maud&#39;s face, &#39;icily regular, splendidly null&#39;.

&quot;What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!&quot; was
the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door
closed upon their guests.  Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,
but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very
naturally laid the blame upon Jo.

&quot;How could you mistake me so?  I merely meant you to be properly
dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and
stone.  Try to be sociable at the Lambs&#39;.  Gossip as other girls do,
and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes
up.  They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to
know, and I wouldn&#39;t fail to make a good impression there for anything.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be agreeable.  I&#39;ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and
raptures over any trifle you like.  I rather enjoy this, and now I&#39;ll
imitate what is called &#39;a charming girl&#39;.  I can do it, for I have May
Chester as a model, and I&#39;ll improve upon her.  See if the Lambs don&#39;t
say, &#39;What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!&quot;

Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there
was no knowing where she would stop.  Amy&#39;s face was a study when she
saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young
ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and
join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken
possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to
hear a long account of Lucretia&#39;s last attack, while three delightful
young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush
in and rescue her.  So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who
seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as
the lady.  A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her
ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with
curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the
fun.  One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this
sort of conversation.

&quot;She rides splendidly.  Who taught her?&quot;

&quot;No one.  She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting
straight on an old saddle in a tree.  Now she rides anything, for she
doesn&#39;t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap
because she trains them to carry ladies so well.  She has such a
passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a
horsebreaker, and get her living so.&quot;

At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the
impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which
was her especial aversion.  But what could she do?  For the old lady
was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off
again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful
blunders.

&quot;Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,
and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that
you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for
a pleasure party, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Which did she choose?&quot; asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who
enjoyed the subject.

&quot;None of them.  She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the
river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,
because he was handsome and spirited.  Her struggles were really
pathetic.  There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she
took the saddle to the horse.  My dear creature, she actually rowed it
over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the
utter amazement of the old man!&quot;

&quot;Did she ride the horse?&quot;

&quot;Of course she did, and had a capital time.  I expected to see her
brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the
life of the party.&quot;

&quot;Well, I call that plucky!&quot; and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving
glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the
girl look so red and uncomfortable.

She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a
sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress.  One
of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore
to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it
was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness,
&quot;Oh, Amy painted it.  You can&#39;t buy those soft shades, so we paint ours
any color we like.  It&#39;s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that an original idea?&quot; cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.

&quot;That&#39;s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There&#39;s
nothing the child can&#39;t do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for
Sallie&#39;s party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest
shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,&quot;
added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister&#39;s accomplishments that
exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her
cardcase at her.

&quot;We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,&quot;
observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,
who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.

Any mention of her &#39;works&#39; always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either
grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque
remark, as now.  &quot;Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write
that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it.  Are you
going to New York this winter?&quot;

As Miss Lamb had &#39;enjoyed&#39; the story, this speech was not exactly
grateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,
but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was
for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an
abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their
mouths.

&quot;Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining
for a visit.  I don&#39;t dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should
come, I don&#39;t think I shall have the heart to send you away.&quot;

Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester&#39;s gushing style
that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong
desire to laugh and cry at the same time.

&quot;Didn&#39;t I do well?&quot; asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.

&quot;Nothing could have been worse,&quot; was Amy&#39;s crushing reply. &quot;What
possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and
boots, and all the rest of it?&quot;

&quot;Why, it&#39;s funny, and amuses people.  They know we are poor, so it&#39;s no
use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season,
and have things as easy and fine as they do.&quot;

&quot;You needn&#39;t go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our
poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way.  You haven&#39;t a bit of proper
pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to
speak,&quot; said Amy despairingly.

Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with
the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.

&quot;How shall I behave here?&quot; she asked, as they approached the third
mansion.

&quot;Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,&quot; was Amy&#39;s short answer.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we&#39;ll have a
comfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance
has a bad effect upon my constitution,&quot; returned Jo gruffly, being
disturbed by her failure to suit.

An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children
speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the
hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted
herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She
listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and
poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that &quot;Tom Brown was a brick,&quot;
regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a
visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma
to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left
in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and
dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an
inspired Frenchwoman.

Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself
to her heart&#39;s content.  Mr. Tudor&#39;s uncle had married an English lady
who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole
family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and
breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best
of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which
set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming
of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has
something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like
that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while
she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.
But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the
British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the
proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from
this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping
that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which
should bring disgrace upon the name of March.

It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the
grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog
reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related
one of Laurie&#39;s pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was
poking turtles with Amy&#39;s cherished parasol, a second was eating
gingerbread over Jo&#39;s best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her
gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her
damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come
again, &quot;It was such fun to hear about Laurie&#39;s larks.&quot;

&quot;Capital boys, aren&#39;t they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after
that.&quot; said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from
habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.

&quot;Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?&quot; asked Amy, wisely refraining from
any comment upon Jo&#39;s dilapidated appearance.

&quot;Don&#39;t like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his
father, and doesn&#39;t speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he
is fast, and I don&#39;t consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let
him alone.&quot;

&quot;You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and
just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,
whose father keeps a grocery store.  If you had just reversed the nod
and the bow, it would have been right,&quot; said Amy reprovingly.

&quot;No, it wouldn&#39;t,&quot; returned Jo, &quot;I neither like, respect, nor admire
Tudor, though his grandfather&#39;s uncle&#39;s nephew&#39;s niece was a third
cousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.
I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman
in spite of the brown paper parcels.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no use trying to argue with you,&quot; began Amy.

&quot;Not the least, my dear,&quot; interrupted Jo, &quot;so let us look amiable, and
drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I&#39;m deeply
grateful.&quot;

The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo
uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being
told that the young ladies were engaged.

&quot;Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.  We can run down
there any time, and it&#39;s really a pity to trail through the dust in our
best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.&quot;

&quot;Speak for yourself, if you please.  Aunt March likes to have us pay
her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It&#39;s a
little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don&#39;t believe it
will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping
boys spoil them.  Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your
bonnet.&quot;

&quot;What a good girl you are, Amy!&quot; said Jo, with a repentant glance from
her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and
spotless still.  &quot;I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to
please people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much
time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and
let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.&quot;

Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,
&quot;Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they
have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you&#39;d
remember that, and practice it, you&#39;d be better liked than I am,
because there is more of you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I&#39;m willing to own
that you are right, only it&#39;s easier for me to risk my life for a
person than to be pleasant to him when I don&#39;t feel like it.  It&#39;s a
great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a greater not to be able to hide them.  I don&#39;t mind saying that
I don&#39;t approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I&#39;m not called upon
to tell him so.  Neither are you, and there is no use in making
yourself disagreeable because he is.&quot;

&quot;But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and
how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any
good, as I know to my sorrow, since I&#39;ve had Teddie to manage.  But
there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word,
and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.&quot;

&quot;Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can&#39;t be taken as a sample of other
boys,&quot; said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have
convulsed the &#39;remarkable boy&#39; if he had heard it.  &quot;If we were belles,
or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but
for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don&#39;t approve
of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn&#39;t have a
particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and
puritanical.&quot;

&quot;So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely
because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That&#39;s a nice sort
of morality.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t argue about it, I only know that it&#39;s the way of the world,
and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their
pains.  I don&#39;t like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.&quot;

&quot;I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the
laughing the world would never get on without them.  We can&#39;t agree
about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will
get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should
rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.&quot;

&quot;Well, compose yourself now, and don&#39;t worry Aunt with your new ideas.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try not to, but I&#39;m always possessed to burst out with some
particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her.  It&#39;s
my doom, and I can&#39;t help it.&quot;

They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very
interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a
conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their
nieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but
Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased
everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit
was felt at once, and both aunts &#39;my deared&#39; her affectionately,
looking what they afterward said emphatically, &quot;That child improves
every day.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to help about the fair, dear?&quot; asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy
sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well
in the young.

&quot;Yes, Aunt.  Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a
table, as I have nothing but my time to give.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; put in Jo decidedly.  &quot;I hate to be patronized, and the
Chesters think it&#39;s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly
connected fair.  I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to
work.&quot;

&quot;I am willing to work.  It&#39;s for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,
and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.
Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.&quot;

&quot;Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It&#39;s a
pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and
that is trying,&quot; observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at
Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.

If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance
for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but
unfortunately, we don&#39;t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see
what goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot
as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a
saving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of
several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of
holding her tongue.

&quot;I don&#39;t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I&#39;d
rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.&quot;

&quot;Ahem!&quot; coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.

&quot;I told you so,&quot; said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.

Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in
the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.

&quot;Do you speak French, dear?&quot; asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy&#39;s.

&quot;Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often
as I like,&quot; replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old
lady to smile affably.

&quot;How are you about languages?&quot; asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.

&quot;Don&#39;t know a word.  I&#39;m very stupid about studying anything, can&#39;t
bear French, it&#39;s such a slippery, silly sort of language,&quot; was the
brusque reply.

Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,
&quot;You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe?  Eyes don&#39;t
trouble you any more, do they?&quot;

&quot;Not at all, thank you, ma&#39;am.  I&#39;m very well, and mean to do great
things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that
joyful time arrives.&quot;

&quot;Good girl!  You deserve to go, and I&#39;m sure you will some day,&quot; said
Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her
ball for her.

    Crosspatch, draw the latch,
    Sit by the fire and spin,

squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to
peep into Jo&#39;s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry
that it was impossible to help laughing.

&quot;Most observing bird,&quot; said the old lady.

&quot;Come and take a walk, my dear?&quot; cried Polly, hopping toward the china
closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.

&quot;Thank you, I will.  Come Amy.&quot; and Jo brought the visit to an end,
feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon
her constitution.  She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy
kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the
impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March
to say, as they vanished...

&quot;You&#39;d better do it, Mary.  I&#39;ll supply the money.&quot; and Aunt Carrol to
reply decidedly, &quot;I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.&quot;



CHAPTER THIRTY

CONSEQUENCES

Mrs. Chester&#39;s fair was so very elegant and select that it was
considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be
invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the
matter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all
parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her
life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on
easily.  The &#39;haughty, uninteresting creature&#39; was let severely alone,
but Amy&#39;s talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the
art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate
and valuable contributions to it.

Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then
there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost
impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,
with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.

May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater
favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling
circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy&#39;s dainty
pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May&#39;s painted vases--that was one
thorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at
a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two.  But
the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for
her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had
whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the
Lambs&#39;. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her
naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the
frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.  No hint of this had
reached the culprits, however, and Amy&#39;s dismay can be imagined, when,
the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches
to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the
supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a
cold look...

&quot;I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about
my giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most
prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are
the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take
this place.  I&#39;m sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in
the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have
another table if you like.&quot;

Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this
little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to
utter it naturally, with Amy&#39;s unsuspicious eyes looking straight at
her full of surprise and trouble.

Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess
what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,
&quot;Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?&quot;

&quot;Now, my dear, don&#39;t have any ill feeling, I beg.  It&#39;s merely a matter
of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this
table is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to
you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but
we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you
have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn&#39;t you like the flower table? The
little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a
charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you
know.&quot;

&quot;Especially to gentlemen,&quot; added May, with a look which enlightened Amy
as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,
but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with
unexpected amiability...

&quot;It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I&#39;ll give up my place here
at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.&quot;

&quot;You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,&quot; began
May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty
racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so
carefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but
Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...

&quot;Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,&quot; and sweeping her
contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that
herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.

&quot;Now she&#39;s mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn&#39;t asked you to speak,  Mama,&quot;
said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.

&quot;Girls&#39; quarrels are soon over,&quot; returned her mother, feeling a trifle
ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.

The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which
cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell
to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.
But everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.
Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the
little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered
like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless
efforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch
wouldn&#39;t stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to
tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best
tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid&#39;s
cheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a
draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the
morrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will
sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.

There was great indignation at home when she told her story that
evening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done
right.  Beth declared she wouldn&#39;t go to the fair at all, and Jo
demanded why she didn&#39;t take all her pretty things and leave those mean
people to get on without her.

&quot;Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such
things, and though I think I&#39;ve a right to be hurt, I don&#39;t intend to
show it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy
actions, won&#39;t they, Marmee?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,
though it&#39;s not very easy to give it sometimes,&quot; said her mother, with
the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and
practicing.

In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,
Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her
enemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that
came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her
table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling
the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique
cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which
on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.
As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable
pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.
Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little
spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns
and flowers, were the words, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;

&quot;I ought, but I don&#39;t,&quot; thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright
page to May&#39;s discontented face behind the big vases, that could not
hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a
minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet
rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise
and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in
street, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a
pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out
of season.  Amy&#39;s conscience preached her a little sermon from that
text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,
took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.

A group of girls were standing about May&#39;s table, admiring the pretty
things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their
voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the
story and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better
spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving
it.  She heard May say sorrowfully...

&quot;It&#39;s too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don&#39;t
want to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.
Now it&#39;s spoiled.&quot;

&quot;I dare say she&#39;d put them back if you asked her,&quot; suggested someone.

&quot;How could I after all the fuss?&quot; began May, but she did not finish,
for Amy&#39;s voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...

&quot;You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I
was just thinking I&#39;d offer to put them back, for they belong to your
table rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive
me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.&quot;

As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,
and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly
thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.

&quot;Now, I call that lovely of her, don&#39;t you?&quot; cried one girl.

May&#39;s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was
evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a
disagreeable laugh, &quot;Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn&#39;t sell them
at her own table.&quot;

Now, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have
them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done
it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as
she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table
to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that
one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.

It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her
table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few
cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long
before night.

The art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd
about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and
fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked
wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and
happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no
hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not
only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his
friends made it a real martyrdom.

She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet
that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no
complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave
her an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a
charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by
getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the
tables were about to be turned.

&quot;Don&#39;t do anything rude, pray Jo; I won&#39;t have any fuss made, so let it
all pass and behave yourself,&quot; begged Amy, as she departed early,
hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little
table.

&quot;I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I
know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and
his boys will lend a hand, and we&#39;ll have a good time yet.&quot; returned
Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar
tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.

&quot;Is that my boy?&quot;

&quot;As sure as this is my girl!&quot; and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm
with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.

&quot;Oh, Teddy, such doings!&quot; and Jo told Amy&#39;s wrongs with sisterly zeal.

&quot;A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I&#39;ll be
hanged if I don&#39;t make them buy every flower she&#39;s got, and camp down
before her table afterward,&quot; said Laurie, espousing her cause with
warmth.

&quot;The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not
arrive in time.  I don&#39;t wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I
shouldn&#39;t wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean
thing they are very likely to do another,&quot; observed Jo in a disgusted
tone.

&quot;Didn&#39;t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was
poorly, I didn&#39;t like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.&quot;

&quot;Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are
just as much yours as mine.  Don&#39;t we always go halves in everything?&quot;
began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.

&quot;Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn&#39;t suit me at
all.  But we mustn&#39;t stand philandering here.  I&#39;ve got to help Amy, so
you go and make yourself splendid, and if you&#39;ll be so very kind as to
let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I&#39;ll bless you
forever.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t you do it now?&quot; asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut
the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the
bars, &quot;Go away, Teddy, I&#39;m busy.&quot;

Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for
Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged
in his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out
en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only
came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy&#39;s taste, and
apparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends
gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,
encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in
the room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing
more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the
conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.

Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily
surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking
up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of
the Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of
the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She
also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and
considered her a model of magnanimity.  As she passed the art table,
she glanced over it for her sister&#39;s things, but saw no sign of them.
&quot;Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,&quot; thought Jo, who could forgive
her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.

&quot;Good evening, Miss Jo.  How does Amy get on?&quot; asked May with a
conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be
generous.

&quot;She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is
enjoying herself.  The flower table is always attractive, you know,
&#39;especially to gentlemen&#39;.&quot; Jo couldn&#39;t resist giving that little slap,
but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to
praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.

&quot;Is Amy&#39;s illumination anywhere about?  I took a fancy to buy that for
Father,&quot; said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister&#39;s work.

&quot;Everything of Amy&#39;s sold long ago.  I took care that the right people
saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,&quot; returned
May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,
that day.

Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked
both touched and surprised by the report of May&#39;s word and manner.

&quot;Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables
as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,&quot; she said,
ordering out &#39;Teddy&#39;s own&#39;, as the girls called the college friends.

&quot;&#39;Charge, Chester, charge!&#39; is the motto for that table, but do your
duty like men, and you&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth of art in every sense
of the word,&quot; said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx
prepared to take the field.

&quot;To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,&quot; said little
Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and
getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...

&quot;Very well, my son, for a small boy!&quot; and walked him off, with a
paternal pat on the head.

&quot;Buy the vases,&quot; whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals
of fire on her enemy&#39;s head.

To May&#39;s great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but
pervaded the hall with one under each arm.  The other gentlemen
speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and
wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted
fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.

Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said
something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam
with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and
anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till
several days later.

The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she
did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look
which said &#39;forgive and forget&#39;.  That satisfied Amy, and when she got
home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a
great bouquet in each.  &quot;The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,&quot;
as Laurie announced with a flourish.

&quot;You&#39;ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character
than I ever gave you credit for, Amy.  You&#39;ve behaved sweetly, and I
respect you with all my heart,&quot; said Jo warmly, as they brushed their
hair together late that night.

&quot;Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.  It must
have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart
on selling your own pretty things.  I don&#39;t believe I could have done
it as kindly as you did,&quot; added Beth from her pillow.

&quot;Why, girls, you needn&#39;t praise me so.  I only did as I&#39;d be done by.
You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true
gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know
how.  I can&#39;t explain exactly, but I want to be above the little
meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women.  I&#39;m far
from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.&quot;

Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, &quot;I understand now
what you mean, and I&#39;ll never laugh at you again. You are getting on
faster than you think, and I&#39;ll take lessons of you in true politeness,
for you&#39;ve learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you&#39;ll get
your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.&quot;

A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be
delighted.  A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March&#39;s face was
illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who
were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.

&quot;Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...&quot;

&quot;Me to go with her!&quot; burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an
uncontrollable rapture.

&quot;No, dear, not you.  It&#39;s Amy.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Mother!  She&#39;s too young, it&#39;s my turn first.  I&#39;ve wanted it so
long.  It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid.  I
must go!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s impossible, Jo.  Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is
not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s always so.  Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn&#39;t
fair, oh, it isn&#39;t fair!&quot; cried Jo passionately.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s partly your own fault, dear.  When Aunt spoke to me
the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent
spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said--&#39;I
planned at first to ask Jo, but as &#39;favors burden her&#39;, and she &#39;hates
French&#39;, I think I won&#39;t venture to invite her.  Amy is more docile,
will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the
trip may give her.&quot;

&quot;Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!  Why can&#39;t I learn to keep it
quiet?&quot; groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing.  When
she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said
sorrowfully...

&quot;I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so
try to bear it cheerfully, and don&#39;t sadden Amy&#39;s pleasure by
reproaches or regrets.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the
basket she had joyfully upset.  &quot;I&#39;ll take a leaf out of her book, and
try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute
of happiness.  But it won&#39;t be easy, for it is a dreadful
disappointment,&quot; and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held
with several very bitter tears.

&quot;Jo, dear, I&#39;m very selfish, but I couldn&#39;t spare you, and I&#39;m glad you
are not going quite yet,&quot; whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and
all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted
in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears,
and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how
gratefully she would bear it.

By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family
jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without
repinings at Amy&#39;s good fortune.  The young lady herself received the
news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,
and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving
such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
visions of art than herself.

&quot;It isn&#39;t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,&quot; she said impressively, as
she scraped her best palette.  &quot;It will decide my career, for if I have
any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove
it.&quot;

&quot;Suppose you haven&#39;t?&quot; said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new
collars which were to be handed over to Amy.

&quot;Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,&quot; replied the
aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face
at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on
vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.

&quot;No, you won&#39;t.  You hate hard work, and you&#39;ll marry some rich man,
and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,&quot; said Jo.

&quot;Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don&#39;t believe that one
will.  I&#39;m sure I wish it would, for if I can&#39;t be an artist myself, I
should like to be able to help those who are,&quot; said Amy, smiling, as if
the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor
drawing teacher.

&quot;Hum!&quot; said Jo, with a sigh.  &quot;If you wish it you&#39;ll have it, for your
wishes are always granted--mine never.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to go?&quot; asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with
her knife.

&quot;Rather!&quot;

&quot;Well, in a year or two I&#39;ll send for you, and we&#39;ll dig in the Forum
for relics, and carry out all the plans we&#39;ve made so many times.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.  I&#39;ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day
comes, if it ever does,&quot; returned Jo, accepting the vague but
magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.

There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment
till Amy was off.  Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue
ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried
till she couldn&#39;t cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the
steamer sailed.  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it
suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her
and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last
lingerer, saying with a sob...

&quot;Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen...&quot;

&quot;I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I&#39;ll come and comfort
you,&quot; whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to
keep his word.

So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and
beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from
the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall
the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see
nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.



CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT

London

Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,
Piccadilly.  It&#39;s not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years
ago, and won&#39;t go anywhere else.  However, we don&#39;t mean to stay long,
so it&#39;s no great matter.  Oh, I can&#39;t begin to tell you how I enjoy it
all!  I never can, so I&#39;ll only give you bits out of my notebook, for
I&#39;ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.

I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after
that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of
pleasant people to amuse me.  Everyone was very kind to me, especially
the officers.  Don&#39;t laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary
aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have
nothing to do, it&#39;s a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would
smoke themselves to death, I&#39;m afraid.

Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so
when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself.  Such
walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves!  It was
almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so
grandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much
good.  As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or
whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and
tooted on the captain&#39;s speaking trumpet, she&#39;d have been in such a
state of rapture.

It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found
it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,
ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen&#39;s countryseats in the
valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,
but I didn&#39;t regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of
little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead.  I
never shall forget it.

At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when
I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung,
with a look at me...

    &quot;Oh, have you e&#39;er heard of Kate Kearney?
    She lives on the banks of Killarney;
    From the glance of her eye,
    Shun danger and fly,
    For fatal&#39;s the glance of Kate Kearney.&quot;

Wasn&#39;t that nonsensical?

We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.  It&#39;s a dirty, noisy place,
and I was glad to leave it.  Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of
dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved
_à la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he
looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned
off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in
them, and said, with a grin, &quot;There yer har, sir.  I&#39;ve given &#39;em the
latest Yankee shine.&quot;  It amused Uncle immensely.  Oh, I must tell you
what that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with
us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was
a lovely one, with &quot;Robert Lennox&#39;s compliments,&quot; on the card.  Wasn&#39;t
that fun, girls? I like traveling.

I never shall get to London if I don&#39;t hurry.  The trip was like riding
through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The
farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,
latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The
very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in
clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got
nervous like Yankee biddies.  Such perfect color I never saw, the grass
so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a
rapture all the way.  So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to
the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the
rate of sixty miles an hour.  Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but
Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn&#39;t be astonished at anything. This
is the way we went on.  Amy, flying up--&quot;Oh, that must be Kenilworth,
that gray place among the trees!&quot;  Flo, darting to my window--&quot;How
sweet!  We must go there sometime, won&#39;t we Papa?&quot; Uncle, calmly
admiring his boots--&quot;No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that&#39;s a
brewery.&quot;

A pause--then Flo cried out, &quot;Bless me, there&#39;s a gallows and a man
going up.&quot;  &quot;Where, where?&quot; shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts
with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.  &quot;A colliery,&quot; remarks
Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.  &quot;Here&#39;s a lovely flock of lambs all
lying down,&quot; says Amy.  &quot;See, Papa, aren&#39;t they pretty?&quot; added Flo
sentimentally.  &quot;Geese, young ladies,&quot; returns Uncle, in a tone that
keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the _Flirtations of
Captain Cavendish_, and I have the scenery all to myself.

Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be
seen but fog and umbrellas.  We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little
between the showers.  Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off
in such a hurry I wasn&#39;t half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a
muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping
in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice
ribbons only sixpence a yard.  I laid in a stock, but shall get my
gloves in Paris.  Doesn&#39;t that sound sort of elegant and rich?

Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and
Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that
it wasn&#39;t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone.  It was so
droll!  For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so
fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up
outside behind somewhere, and I couldn&#39;t get at him.  He didn&#39;t hear me
call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite
helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck
pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on
poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...

&quot;Now, then, mum?&quot;

I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with
an &quot;Aye, aye, mum,&quot; the man made his horse walk, as if going to a
funeral.  I poked again and said, &quot;A little faster,&quot; then off he went,
helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.

Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more
aristocratic than we look.  The Duke of Devonshire lives near.  I often
see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington&#39;s
house is not far off.  Such sights as I saw, my dear!  It was as good
as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and
yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet
coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front.  Smart maids, with
the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,
dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and
tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,
looking so funny I longed to sketch them.

Rotten Row means &#39;Route de Roi&#39;, or the king&#39;s way, but now it&#39;s more
like a riding school than anything else.  The horses are splendid, and
the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and
bounce, which isn&#39;t according to our rules.  I longed to show them a
tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in
their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy
Noah&#39;s Ark.  Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little
children--and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair
exchange rose buds, for it&#39;s the thing to wear one in the button-hole,
and I thought it rather a nice little idea.

In the P.M.  to Westminster Abbey, but don&#39;t expect me to describe it,
that&#39;s impossible, so I&#39;ll only say it was sublime! This evening we are
going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest
day of my life.

It&#39;s very late, but I can&#39;t let my letter go in the morning without
telling you what happened last evening.  Who do you think came in, as
we were at tea?  Laurie&#39;s English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn!  I
was so surprised, for I shouldn&#39;t have known them but for the cards.
Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English
style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no
crutches.  They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to
ask us to their house, but Uncle won&#39;t go, so we shall return the call,
and see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did
have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I
talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other
all our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of
her ill health.  Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his
&#39;respectful compliments to the big hat&#39;. Neither of them had forgotten
Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there.  What ages ago it seems,
doesn&#39;t it?

Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop.  I
really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late,
with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks,
theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say &quot;Ah!&quot; and twirl
their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness.  I long to see
you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving...

AMY


PARIS

Dear girls,

In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns
were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.  I enjoyed the trips
to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for
at Hampton I saw Raphael&#39;s cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of
pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great
creatures.  The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular
English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I
could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.  We &#39;did&#39;
London to our heart&#39;s content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry
to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when
they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in
hospitality, I think.  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,
and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don&#39;t, for Grace and I
are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.

Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he
had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober
at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn&#39;t say a word.  And now
we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like
a native, and I don&#39;t know what we should do without him.  Uncle
doesn&#39;t know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if
it would make people understand him.  Aunt&#39;s pronunciation is
old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we
knew a good deal, find we don&#39;t, and are very grateful to have Fred do
the &#39;_parley vooing_&#39;, as Uncle calls it.

Such delightful times as we are having!  Sight-seeing from morning till
night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with
all sorts of droll adventures.  Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,
revelling in pictures.  Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of
the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I&#39;m
cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can.  She would like the relics
of great people better, for I&#39;ve seen her Napoleon&#39;s cocked hat and
gray coat, his baby&#39;s cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie
Antoinette&#39;s little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne&#39;s sword,
and many other interesting things.  I&#39;ll talk for hours about them when
I come, but haven&#39;t time to write.

The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of _bijouterie_ and
lovely things that I&#39;m nearly distracted because I can&#39;t buy them.
Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn&#39;t allow it.  Then the
Bois and Champs Elysees are _tres magnifique_. I&#39;ve seen the imperial
family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the
empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought--purple
dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who
sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he
passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets
and a mounted guard before and behind.

We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the
antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very
curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,
one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for
the mourners to sit in when they come to lament.  That is so Frenchy.

Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look
up and down the long, brilliant street.  It is so pleasant that we
spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day&#39;s work to
go out.  Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most
agreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more
charming.  I wish Fred was dark, for I don&#39;t fancy light men, however,
the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won&#39;t
find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.

Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel
fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters.  I keep my diary,
and try to &#39;remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and
admire&#39;, as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my
sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.

Adieu, I embrace you tenderly. _&quot;Votre Amie.&quot;_


HEIDELBERG

My dear Mamma,

Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I&#39;ll try to tell you
what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.

The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with
all my might.  Get Father&#39;s old guidebooks and read about it.  I
haven&#39;t words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a
lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted
on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about
one o&#39;clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our
windows.  We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed
us Fred and the students singing away down below.  It was the most
romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great
fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart
of stone.

When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble
for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing
away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.  Next morning Fred showed me
one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very
sentimental.  I laughed at him, and said I didn&#39;t throw it, but Flo,
which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and
turned sensible again.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have trouble with that
boy, it begins to look like it.

The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost
some money, and I scolded him.  He needs someone to look after him when
Frank is not with him.  Kate said once she hoped he&#39;d marry soon, and I
quite agree with her that it would be well for him.  Frankfurt was
delightful.  I saw Goethe&#39;s house, Schiller&#39;s statue, and Dannecker&#39;s
famous &#39;Ariadne.&#39;  It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it
more if I had known the story better.  I didn&#39;t like to ask, as
everyone knew it or pretended they did.  I wish Jo would tell me all
about it.  I ought to have read more, for I find I don&#39;t know anything,
and it mortifies me.

Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just
gone.  He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him.
I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the
serenade night.  Since then I&#39;ve begun to feel that the moonlight
walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him
than fun.  I haven&#39;t flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you
said to me, and have done my very best.  I can&#39;t help it if people like
me.  I don&#39;t try to make them, and it worries me if I don&#39;t care for
them, though Jo says I haven&#39;t got any heart.  Now I know Mother will
shake her head, and the girls say, &quot;Oh, the mercenary little wretch!&quot;,
but I&#39;ve made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,
though I&#39;m not madly in love.  I like him, and we get on comfortably
together.  He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so
much richer than the Laurences.  I don&#39;t think his family would object,
and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous
people, and they like me.  Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the
estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is!  A city house in a
fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as
comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe
in.  I like it, for it&#39;s genuine.  I&#39;ve seen the plate, the family
jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its
park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses.  Oh, it would be
all I should ask!  And I&#39;d rather have it than any title such as girls
snap up so readily, and find nothing behind.  I may be mercenary, but I
hate poverty, and don&#39;t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can
help.  One of us _must_ marry well.  Meg didn&#39;t, Jo won&#39;t, Beth can&#39;t
yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round.  I wouldn&#39;t marry
a man I hated or despised.  You may be sure of that, and though Fred is
not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond
enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.
So I&#39;ve been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it
was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me.  He said nothing, but
little things showed it.  He never goes with Flo, always gets on my
side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we
are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.
Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then
said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about &#39;_ein
wonderschones Blondchen&#39;_, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his
meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.  He isn&#39;t one of the
cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood
in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.

Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all
of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post
Restante for letters.  We had a charming time poking about the ruins,
the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by
the elector long ago for his English wife.  I liked the great terrace
best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms
inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion&#39;s head on the
wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it.  I felt as if I&#39;d
got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through
the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and
waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.  I had a feeling that
something was going to happen and I was ready for it.  I didn&#39;t feel
blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.

By-and-by I heard Fred&#39;s voice, and then he came hurrying through the
great arch to find me.  He looked so troubled that I forgot all about
myself, and asked what the matter was.  He said he&#39;d just got a letter
begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill.  So he was going at
once on the night train and only had time to say good-by.  I was very
sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute
because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could
not mistake,  &quot;I shall soon come back, you won&#39;t forget me, Amy?&quot;

I didn&#39;t promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and
there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was
off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to
speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised
his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash
boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.  We shall
soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don&#39;t change my mind, I&#39;ll say &quot;Yes,
thank you,&quot; when he says &quot;Will you, please?&quot;

Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know what was
going on.  Don&#39;t be anxious about me, remember I am your &#39;prudent Amy&#39;,
and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you
like.  I&#39;ll use it if I can.  I wish I could see you for a good talk,
Marmee.  Love and trust me.

Ever your AMY



CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

TENDER TROUBLES

&quot;Jo, I&#39;m anxious about Beth.&quot;

&quot;Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not her health that troubles me now, it&#39;s her spirits. I&#39;m sure
there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think so, Mother?&quot;

&quot;She sits alone a good deal, and doesn&#39;t talk to her father as much as
she used.  I found her crying over the babies the other day.  When she
sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in
her face that I don&#39;t understand. This isn&#39;t like Beth, and it worries
me.&quot;

&quot;Have you asked her about it?&quot;

&quot;I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or
looked so distressed that I stopped.  I never force my children&#39;s
confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.&quot;

Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed
quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth&#39;s, and after
sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, &quot;I think she is growing up,
and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets,
without knowing why or being able to explain them.  Why, Mother, Beth&#39;s
eighteen, but we don&#39;t realize it, and treat her like a child,
forgetting she&#39;s a woman.&quot;

&quot;So she is.  Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,&quot; returned her mother
with a sigh and a smile.

&quot;Can&#39;t be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of
worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one.  I promise
never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a great comfort, Jo.  I always feel strong when you are at home,
now Meg is gone.  Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon,
but when the tug comes, you are always ready.&quot;

&quot;Why, you know I don&#39;t mind hard jobs much, and there must always be
one scrub in a family.  Amy is splendid in fine works and I&#39;m not, but
I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half
the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but
if anything is amiss at home, I&#39;m your man.&quot;

&quot;I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little
heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else.  Be very kind, and don&#39;t
let her think anyone watches or talks about her.  If she only would get
quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn&#39;t have a wish in the world.&quot;

&quot;Happy woman!  I&#39;ve got heaps.&quot;

&quot;My dear, what are they?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll settle Bethy&#39;s troubles, and then I&#39;ll tell you mine. They are
not very wearing, so they&#39;ll keep.&quot; and Jo stitched away, with a wise
nod which set her mother&#39;s heart at rest about her for the present at
least.

While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and
after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which
seemed to explain the change in her.  A slight incident gave Jo the
clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did
the rest.  She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,
when she and Beth were alone together.  Yet as she scribbled, she kept
her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet.  Sitting at the
window, Beth&#39;s work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head
upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the
dull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling
like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, &quot;All serene! Coming
in tonight.&quot;

Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by
till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, &quot;How
strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.&quot;

&quot;Hum!&quot; said Jo, still intent upon her sister&#39;s face, for the bright
color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a
tear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her
half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.
Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about
needing more paper.

&quot;Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!&quot; she said, sitting down in her own
room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had
just made.  &quot;I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say?  I
wonder if her...&quot;  there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden
thought.  &quot;If he shouldn&#39;t love back again, how dreadful it would be.
He must.  I&#39;ll make him!&quot; and she shook her head threateningly at the
picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.
&quot;Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here&#39;s Meg married and a
mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I&#39;m the only
one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.&quot; Jo thought intently
for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out
her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face
opposite, &quot;No thank you, sir, you&#39;re very charming, but you&#39;ve no more
stability than a weathercock.  So you needn&#39;t write touching notes and
smile in that insinuating way, for it won&#39;t do a bit of good, and I
won&#39;t have it.&quot;

Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake
till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which
only confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked
with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,
but so was everybody&#39;s. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he
cared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression
had prevailed in the family of late that &#39;our boy&#39; was getting fonder
than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn&#39;t hear a word upon the subject
and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known
the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they
would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, &quot;I told you so.&quot;
But Jo hated &#39;philandering&#39;, and wouldn&#39;t allow it, always having a
joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.

When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,
but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much
amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,
despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly
conferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at
many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged
occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender
subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,
and gave out that he was going to &#39;dig&#39;, intending to graduate in a
blaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight
confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the
eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred
imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former
could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter
were less manageable.

Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo
watched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not
got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in
the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But
having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at
a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course
of romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on
the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all
sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly &#39;spin&#39;, and he never
disappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth&#39;s eyes rested
on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that
she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting
cricket match, though the phrases, &#39;caught off a tice&#39;, &#39;stumped off
his ground&#39;, and &#39;the leg hit for three&#39;, were as intelligible to her
as Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,
that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie&#39;s manner, that
he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a
little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth&#39;s feet with an
assiduity that was really almost tender.

&quot;Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,&quot; thought Jo, as she fussed
about the room.  &quot;She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make
life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love
each other.  I don&#39;t see how he can help it, and I do believe he would
if the rest of us were out of the way.&quot;

As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she
ought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?
And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she
sat down to settle that point.

Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,
well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the
girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,
rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested
tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young
women.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner
had always been Jo&#39;s favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows
that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with
prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.
This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon
of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.

Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep
aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when
romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he
most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If &#39;the sausage&#39; as they
called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and
repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child
who dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,
and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form
appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both
long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of
satisfaction...

&quot;Now, this is filling at the price.&quot;

&quot;No slang,&quot; snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,
there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared
in a most mysterious manner.

&quot;Come, Jo, don&#39;t be thorny.  After studying himself to a skeleton all
the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.&quot;

&quot;Beth will pet you.  I&#39;m busy.&quot;

&quot;No, she&#39;s not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing,
unless you&#39;ve suddenly lost your taste for it.  Have you? Do you hate
your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?&quot;

Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,
but Jo quenched &#39;her boy&#39; by turning on him with a stern query, &quot;How
many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?&quot;

&quot;Not one, upon my word.  She&#39;s engaged.  Now then.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of it, that&#39;s one of your foolish extravagances, sending
flowers and things to girls for whom you don&#39;t care two pins,&quot;
continued Jo reprovingly.

&quot;Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won&#39;t let me
send them &#39;flowers and things&#39;, so what can I do? My feelings need a
&#39;vent&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Mother doesn&#39;t approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt
desperately, Teddy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d give anything if I could answer, &#39;So do you&#39;.  As I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll
merely say that I don&#39;t see any harm in that pleasant little game, if
all parties understand that it&#39;s only play.&quot;

&quot;Well, it does look pleasant, but I can&#39;t learn how it&#39;s done. I&#39;ve
tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else
is doing, but I don&#39;t seem to get on&quot;, said Jo, forgetting to play
mentor.

&quot;Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far.  I
suppose it&#39;s natural to some people to please without trying, and
others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you can&#39;t flirt.  It&#39;s really refreshing to see a sensible,
straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool
of herself.  Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do
go on at such a rate I&#39;m ashamed of them. They don&#39;t mean any harm, I&#39;m
sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward,
they&#39;d mend their ways, I fancy.&quot;

&quot;They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows
get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit.  If you
behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they
keep it up, and then you blame them.&quot;

&quot;Much you know about it, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Laurie in a superior tone. &quot;We
don&#39;t like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.
The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,
among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul!  If you could be in my place
for a month you&#39;d see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my
word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say
with our friend Cock Robin...

    &quot;Out upon you, fie upon you,
     Bold-faced jig!&quot;

It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between
Laurie&#39;s chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very
natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society
showed him many samples.  Jo knew that &#39;young Laurence&#39; was regarded as
a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their
daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb
of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be
spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still
believed in modest girls.  Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone,
she said, dropping her voice, &quot;If you must have a &#39;vent&#39;, Teddy, go and
devote yourself to one of the &#39;pretty, modest girls&#39; whom you do
respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.&quot;

&quot;You really advise it?&quot; and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of
anxiety and merriment in his face.

&quot;Yes, I do, but you&#39;d better wait till you are through college, on the
whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime.  You&#39;re not half
good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be.&quot; and Jo looked a
little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.

&quot;That I&#39;m not!&quot; acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite
new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo&#39;s apron tassel
round his finger.

&quot;Mercy on us, this will never do,&quot; thought Jo, adding aloud, &quot;Go and
sing to me.  I&#39;m dying for some music, and always like yours.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather stay here, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t, there isn&#39;t room.  Go and make yourself useful, since
you are too big to be ornamental.  I thought you hated to be tied to a
woman&#39;s apron string?&quot; retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of
his own.

&quot;Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!&quot; and Laurie gave an audacious
tweak at the tassel.

&quot;Are you going?&quot; demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.

He fled at once, and the minute it was well, &quot;Up with the bonnets of
bonnie Dundee,&quot; she slipped away to return no more till the young
gentleman departed in high dudgeon.

Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound
of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth&#39;s bedside, with the anxious
inquiry, &quot;What is it, dear?&quot;

&quot;I thought you were asleep,&quot; sobbed Beth.

&quot;Is it the old pain, my precious?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s a new one, but I can bear it,&quot; and Beth tried to check her
tears.

&quot;Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t, there is no cure.&quot;  There Beth&#39;s voice gave way, and
clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was
frightened.

&quot;Where is it?  Shall I call Mother?&quot;

&quot;No, no, don&#39;t call her, don&#39;t tell her.  I shall be better soon.  Lie
down here and &#39;poor&#39; my head.  I&#39;ll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I
will.&quot;

Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth&#39;s hot
forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to
speak.  But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,
cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she
believed she knew the cause of Beth&#39;s new pain, she only said, in her
tenderest tone, &quot;Does anything trouble you, deary?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Jo,&quot; after a long pause.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it comfort you to tell me what it is?&quot;

&quot;Not now, not yet.&quot;

&quot;Then I won&#39;t ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always
glad to hear and help you, if they can.&quot;

&quot;I know it.  I&#39;ll tell you by-and-by.&quot;

&quot;Is the pain better now?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.&quot;

&quot;Go to sleep, dear.  I&#39;ll stay with you.&quot;

So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite
herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and
a loving word can medicine most ills.

But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for
some days, she confided it to her mother.

&quot;You asked me the other day what my wishes were.  I&#39;ll tell you one of
them, Marmee,&quot; she began, as they sat along together.  &quot;I want to go
away somewhere this winter for a change.&quot;

&quot;Why, Jo?&quot; and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested
a double meaning.

With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, &quot;I want something new.
I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than
I am.  I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring
up, so as I can be spared this winter, I&#39;d like to hop a little way and
try my wings.&quot;

&quot;Where will you hop?&quot;

&quot;To New York.  I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it.  You know
Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her
children and sew.  It&#39;s rather hard to find just the thing, but I think
I should suit if I tried.&quot;

&quot;My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!&quot; and Mrs.
March looked surprised, but not displeased.

&quot;It&#39;s not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your
friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make things
pleasant for me, I know.  Her family is separate from the rest, and no
one knows me there.  Don&#39;t care if they do. It&#39;s honest work, and I&#39;m
not ashamed of it.&quot;

&quot;Nor I.  But your writing?&quot;

&quot;All the better for the change.  I shall see and hear new things, get
new ideas, and even if I haven&#39;t much time there, I shall bring home
quantities of material for my rubbish.&quot;

&quot;I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden
fancy?&quot;

&quot;No, Mother.&quot;

&quot;May I know the others?&quot;

Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in
her cheeks.  &quot;It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I&#39;m
afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me.&quot;

&quot;Then you don&#39;t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care
for you?&quot; and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.

&quot;Mercy, no!  I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely
proud of him, but as for anything more, it&#39;s out of the question.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of that, Jo.&quot;

&quot;Why, please?&quot;

&quot;Because, dear, I don&#39;t think you suited to one another.  As friends
you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I
fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much
alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong
wills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite
patience and forbearance, as well as love.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just the feeling I had, though I couldn&#39;t express it. I&#39;m glad
you think he is only beginning to care for me.  It would trouble me
sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn&#39;t fall in love with the dear
old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?&quot;

&quot;You are sure of his feeling for you?&quot;

The color deepened in Jo&#39;s cheeks as she answered, with the look of
mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking
of first lovers, &quot;I&#39;m afraid it is so, Mother.  He hasn&#39;t said
anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away
before it comes to anything.&quot;

&quot;I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.&quot;

Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, &quot;How Mrs. Moffat
would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will
rejoice that Annie may still hope.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the
same in all--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I
am content with her success.  You I leave to enjoy your liberty till
you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something
sweeter.  Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her.
For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well.  By the way,
she seems brighter this last day or two.  Have you spoken to her?&#39;

&quot;Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by.
I said no more, for I think I know it,&quot; and Jo told her little story.

Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the
case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for Laurie&#39;s sake
Jo should go away for a time.

&quot;Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I&#39;ll
run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think
I&#39;m going to please myself, as I am, for I can&#39;t talk about Laurie to
her.  But she can pet and comfort him after I&#39;m gone, and so cure him
of this romantic notion.  He&#39;s been through so many little trials of
the sort, he&#39;s used to it, and will soon get over his lovelornity.&quot;

Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear
that this &#39;little trial&#39; would be harder than the others, and that
Laurie would not get over his &#39;lovelornity&#39; as easily as heretofore.

The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs.
Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.
The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got
might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society
would be both useful and agreeable.  Jo liked the prospect and was
eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her
restless nature and adventurous spirit.  When all was settled, with
fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he took it very
quietly.  He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and
when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly,
&quot;So I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned.&quot;

Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on
just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, for Beth
seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best for all.

&quot;One thing I leave in your especial care,&quot; she said, the night before
she left.

&quot;You mean your papers?&quot; asked Beth.

&quot;No, my boy.  Be very good to him, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Of course I will, but I can&#39;t fill your place, and he&#39;ll miss you
sadly.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague,
pet, and keep in order.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do my best, for your sake,&quot; promised Beth, wondering why Jo
looked at her so queerly.

When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, &quot;It won&#39;t do a
bit of good, Jo.  My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I&#39;ll come
and bring you home.&quot;



CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

JO&#39;S JOURNAL

New York, November

Dear Marmee and Beth,

I&#39;m going to write you a regular volume, for I&#39;ve got heaps to tell,
though I&#39;m not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I
lost sight of Father&#39;s dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might
have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small
children, all crying more or less, hadn&#39;t diverted my mind, for I
amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time
they opened their mouths to roar.

Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up
likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.

Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that
big house full of strangers.  She gave me a funny little sky
parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a
sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like.  A fine view
and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a
fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew,
is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke&#39;s private parlor, and the two little
girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me
after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I&#39;ve no doubt I shall make a
model governess.

I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great
table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will
believe it.

&quot;Now, my dear, make yourself at home,&quot; said Mrs. K.  in her motherly
way, &quot;I&#39;m on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with
such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the
children are safe with you.  My rooms are always open to you, and your
own shall be as comfortable as I can make it.  There are some pleasant
people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always
free.  Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.
There&#39;s the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.&quot;  And off she
bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.

As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights
are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of
the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman
come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand,
carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away,
saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, &quot;It goes better so.  The
little back is too young to haf such heaviness.&quot;

Wasn&#39;t it good of him?  I like such things, for as Father says, trifles
show character.  When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she
laughed, and said, &quot;That must have been Professor Bhaer, he&#39;s always
doing things of that sort.&quot;

Mrs. K.  told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as
a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little
orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of
his sister, who married an American.  Not a very romantic story, but it
interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K.  lends him her
parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and
the nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I&#39;ll tell you how he
looks.  He&#39;s almost forty, so it&#39;s no harm, Marmee.

After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the
big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend.  I
shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and
more tomorrow.

Tuesday Eve

Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted
like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all
round.  Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up
till they were glad to sit down and keep still.  After luncheon, the
girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little
Mabel &#39;with a willing mind&#39;.  I was thanking my stars that I&#39;d learned
to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and
someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was
dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation, and
lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in.
Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a
good look at him.  A regular German--rather stout, with brown hair
tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I
ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one&#39;s ears good, after our
sharp or slipshod American gabble.  His clothes were rusty, his hands
were large, and he hadn&#39;t a really handsome feature in his face, except
his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen
was very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were
off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe.  He looked sober in
spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth
bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old
friend.  Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in
a loud, brisk tone, &quot;Herein!&quot;

I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child
carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.

&quot;Me wants me Bhaer,&quot; said the mite, slamming down her book and running
to meet him.

&quot;Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.  Come, then, and take a goot hug from him,
my Tina,&quot; said the Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding
her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss
him.

&quot;Now me mus tuddy my lessin,&quot; went on the funny little thing.  So he
put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought,
and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf
now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if
finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,
while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look
that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French
than German.

Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my
work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and
gabbling that went on next door.  One of the girls kept laughing
affectedly, and saying, &quot;Now Professor,&quot; in a coquettish tone, and the
other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard
for him to keep sober.

Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him
say emphatically, &quot;No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I
say,&quot; and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his
book, followed by the despairing exclamation, &quot;Prut!  It all goes bad
this day.&quot;

Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one
more peep to see if he survived it.  He seemed to have thrown himself
back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the
clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if
ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep
on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away.  I fancy he has a
hard life of it.  Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn&#39;t go down to the five
o&#39;clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,
just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.  So I
made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as
she is short and I&#39;m tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a
failure.  She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I
plucked up courage and looked about me.  The long table was full, and
every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who
seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the
word, vanishing as soon as they were done.  There was the usual
assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed
in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in
politics.  I don&#39;t think I shall care to have much to do with any of
them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had
something in her.

Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting
answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on
one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other.  If Amy
had been here, she&#39;d have turned her back on him forever because, sad
to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a
manner which would have horrified &#39;her ladyship&#39;.  I didn&#39;t mind, for I
like &#39;to see folks eat with a relish&#39;, as Hannah says, and the poor man
must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.

As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling
their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the
other, &quot;Who&#39;s the new party?&quot;

&quot;Governess, or something of that sort.&quot;

&quot;What the deuce is she at our table for?&quot;

&quot;Friend of the old lady&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Handsome head, but no style.&quot;

&quot;Not a bit of it.  Give us a light and come on.&quot;

I felt angry at first, and then I didn&#39;t care, for a governess is as
good as a clerk, and I&#39;ve got sense, if I haven&#39;t style, which is more
than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings
who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys.  I hate ordinary people!


Thursday

Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my
little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire.  I picked up a
few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor.  It seems that
Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the
laundry here.  The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and
follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which
delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a &#39;bacheldore&#39;.
Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all
sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings,
and the splendid tales he tells.  The younger men quiz him, it seems,
call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of
jokes on his name.  But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and
takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his
foreign ways.

The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind.  She
spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it&#39;s such fun
to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room.  She
has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems
friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into
good society, only it isn&#39;t the same sort that Amy likes.

I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some
newspapers for Mrs. Kirke.  She wasn&#39;t there, but Minnie, who is a
little old woman, introduced me very prettily. &quot;This is Mamma&#39;s friend,
Miss March.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and she&#39;s jolly and we like her lots,&quot; added Kitty, who is an
&#39;enfant terrible&#39;.

We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the
blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.

&quot;Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.  If so
again, call at me and I come,&quot; he said, with a threatening frown that
delighted the little wretches.

I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I was doomed to
see a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my way out,
by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella.  It flew open, and
there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand
and a darning needle in the other.  He didn&#39;t seem at all ashamed of
it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and
all, saying in his loud, cheerful way...

&quot;You haf a fine day to make your walk.  Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.&quot;

I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to
think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German
gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not
so pretty.


Saturday

Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who
has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she
showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with
her to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed them.  She
put it as a favor, but I&#39;m sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and
she does it out of kindness to me.  I&#39;m as proud as Lucifer, but such
favors from such people don&#39;t burden me, and I accepted gratefully.

When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor
that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees,
with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie
feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in
cages built of chairs.

&quot;We are playing nargerie,&quot; explained Kitty.

&quot;Dis is mine effalunt!&quot; added Tina, holding on by the Professor&#39;s hair.

&quot;Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when
Franz and Emil come, doesn&#39;t she, Mr. Bhaer?&quot; said Minnie.

The &#39;effalunt&#39; sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and
said soberly to me, &quot;I gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a
noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly.&quot;

I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much
as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed.  They played
tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they
all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming
fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little
&#39;koblods&#39;, who ride the snowflakes as they fall.  I wish Americans were
as simple and natural as Germans, don&#39;t you?

I&#39;m so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of
economy didn&#39;t stop me, for though I&#39;ve used thin paper and written
fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need.
Pray forward Amy&#39;s as soon as you can spare them.  My small news will
sound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, I know.
Is Teddy studying so hard that he can&#39;t find time to write to his
friends?  Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the
babies, and give heaps of love to everyone.  From your faithful Jo.

P.S.  On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I
am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to
write about.  Bless you!

DECEMBER

My Precious Betsey,

As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it
may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though
quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful!  After what
Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral
agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend
as I could wish.  They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the
boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me.  Franz and
Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture
of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of
effervescence.  Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in
the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a
seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such
fun!

We are very good friends now, and I&#39;ve begun to take lessons.  I really
couldn&#39;t help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must
tell you.  To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day
as I passed Mr. Bhaer&#39;s room where she was rummaging.

&quot;Did you ever see such a den, my dear?  Just come and help me put these
books to rights, for I&#39;ve turned everything upside down, trying to
discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not
long ago.&quot;

I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was &#39;a den&#39; to
be sure.  Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old
flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any
tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the
other.  Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the
manuscripts.  Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and
traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of
himself, were to be seen all over the room.  After a grand rummage
three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage, one
covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a
holder.

&quot;Such a man!&quot; laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in
the rag bay.  &quot;I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage
cut fingers, or make kite tails.  It&#39;s dreadful, but I can&#39;t scold him.
He&#39;s so absent-minded and goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him
roughshod.  I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to
give out his things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a
sad pass sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Let me mend them,&quot; said I.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind it, and he needn&#39;t know.
I&#39;d like to, he&#39;s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending
books.&quot;

So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the
socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns.
Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn&#39;t find it out, but one day last
week he caught me at it.  Hearing the lessons he gives to others has
interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina
runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear.  I had been
sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to
understand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.
The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I
was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most
absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer
looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray
him.

&quot;So!&quot; he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, &quot;you peep at me, I
peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am not pleasanting when I
say, haf you a wish for German?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but you are too busy.  I am too stupid to learn,&quot; I blundered
out, as red as a peony.

&quot;Prut!  We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense.  At
efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you,
Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.&quot;  And he pointed to my work &#39;Yes,&#39;
they say to one another, these so kind ladies, &#39;he is a stupid old
fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock
heels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new
when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.&#39; &quot;Ah!  But I
haf an eye, and I see much.  I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.
Come, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me
and mine.&quot;

Of course I couldn&#39;t say anything after that, and as it really is a
splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began.  I took four
lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.  The Professor was
very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and
then he&#39;d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it
was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry.  I tried both ways, and
when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just threw
the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself
disgraced and deserted forever, but didn&#39;t blame him a particle, and
was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake
myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I&#39;d covered
myself in glory.

&quot;Now we shall try a new way.  You and I will read these pleasant little
_marchen_ together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the
corner for making us trouble.&quot;

He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Anderson&#39;s fairy tales so
invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my
lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely.
I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express
it) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according
to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best.  When I finished
reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and
cried out in his hearty way, &quot;Das ist gut! Now we go well!  My turn.  I
do him in German, gif me your ear.&quot;  And away he went, rumbling out the
words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well
as hear.  Fortunately the story was _The Constant Tin Soldier_, which
is droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I did, though I didn&#39;t
understand half he read, for I couldn&#39;t help it, he was so earnest, I
so excited, and the whole thing so comical.

After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for
this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets
tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly.  I like
it very much, and he doesn&#39;t seem tired of it yet, which is very good
of him, isn&#39;t it?  I mean to give him something on Christmas, for I
dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.

I&#39;m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking
and lets his hair grow.  You see Beth manages him better than I did.
I&#39;m not jealous, dear, do your best, only don&#39;t make a saint of him.
I&#39;m afraid I couldn&#39;t like him without a spice of human naughtiness.
Read him bits of my letters.  I haven&#39;t time to write much, and that
will do just as well.  Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.

JANUARY

A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course
includes Mr. L.  and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can&#39;t tell you
how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn&#39;t get it till
night and had given up hoping.  Your letter came in the morning, but
you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was
disappointed, for I&#39;d had a &#39;kind of feeling&#39; that you wouldn&#39;t forget
me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea,
and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I
just hugged it and pranced.  It was so homey and refreshing that I sat
down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in
my usual absurd way.  The things were just what I wanted, and all the
better for being made instead of bought.  Beth&#39;s new &#39;ink bib&#39; was
capital, and Hannah&#39;s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure.  I&#39;ll
be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully
the books Father has marked.  Thank you all, heaps and heaps!

Speaking of books reminds me that I&#39;m getting rich in that line, for on
New Year&#39;s Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he
values much, and I&#39;ve often admired it, set up in the place of honor
with his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how
I felt when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own
name in it, &quot;from my friend Friedrich Bhaer&quot;.

&quot;You say often you wish a library.  Here I gif you one, for between
these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.  Read him well, and
he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will
help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.&quot;

I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about &#39;my library&#39;, as
if I had a hundred books.  I never knew how much there was in
Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me.
Now don&#39;t laugh at his horrid name.  It isn&#39;t pronounced either Bear or
Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only
Germans can give it. I&#39;m glad you both like what I tell you about him,
and hope you will know him some day.  Mother would admire his warm
heart, Father his wise head.  I admire both, and feel rich in my new
&#39;friend Friedrich Bhaer&#39;.

Not having much money, or knowing what he&#39;d like, I got several little
things, and put them about the room, where he would find them
unexpectedly.  They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on
his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of
green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his
blower, so that he needn&#39;t burn up what Amy calls &#39;mouchoirs&#39;.  I made
it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black
and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy
immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so
it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn&#39;t forget a
servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French
laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him.  I was so glad of that.

They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year&#39;s Eve.  I didn&#39;t
mean to go down, having no dress.  But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke
remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and
feathers.  So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask
on.  No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of
the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and
cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and
dress, and burst out into a &#39;nice derangement of epitaphs, like an
allegory on the banks of the Nile&#39;.  I enjoyed it very much, and when
we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me.  I heard one of the
young men tell another that he knew I&#39;d been an actress, in fact, he
thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters.  Meg will
relish that joke.  Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a
perfect little fairy in his arms.  To see them dance was &#39;quite a
landscape&#39;, to use a Teddyism.

I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over in
my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many
failures, for I&#39;m cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take
more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory.
Bless you all!  Ever your loving...  Jo



CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR

FRIEND

Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy
with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the
effort, Jo still found time for literary labors.  The purpose which now
took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl,
but the means she took to gain her end were not the best.  She saw that
money conferred power, money and power, therefore, she resolved to
have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved
more than life.  The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth
everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her
bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so
that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years
Jo&#39;s most cherished castle in the air.

The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after
long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en
Espagne.  But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for
public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on
bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed
awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the
least lovely of the giant&#39;s treasures, if I remember rightly.  But the
&#39;up again and take another&#39; spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so
she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but
nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.

She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even
all-perfect America read rubbish.  She told no one, but concocted a
&#39;thrilling tale&#39;, and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor
of the Weekly Volcano.  She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had
a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over
many than the worth of character or the magic of manners.  So she
dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she
was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and
dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar
smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels
rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them
took the trouble to remove on her appearance.  Somewhat daunted by this
reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much
embarrassment...

&quot;Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to
see Mr. Dashwood.&quot;

Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,
and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced
with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling
that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her
manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,
blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the
occasion.

&quot;A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an
experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this
suits.&quot;

While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,
and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers,
and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.

&quot;Not a first attempt, I take it?&quot; observing that the pages were
numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon--sure
sign of a novice.

&quot;No, sir.  She has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in
the _Blarneystone Banner_.&quot;

&quot;Oh, did she?&quot; and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to
take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the
buttons on her boots.  &quot;Well, you can leave it, if you like.  We&#39;ve
more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at
present, but I&#39;ll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.&quot;

Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn&#39;t suit her at
all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but
bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was
apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was
perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the
gentlemen that her little fiction of &#39;my friend&#39; was considered a good
joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as
he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.  Half resolving never
to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching
pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh
over the scene and long for next week.

When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced.  Mr.
Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable, and Mr.
Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his
manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the
first.

&quot;We&#39;ll take this (editors never say I), if you don&#39;t object to a few
alterations.  It&#39;s too long, but omitting the passages I&#39;ve marked will
make it just the right length,&quot; he said, in a businesslike tone.

Jo hardly knew her own MS.  again, so crumpled and underscored were its
pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being
asked to cut off her baby&#39;s legs in order that it might fit into a new
cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find
that all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as
ballast for much romance--had been stricken out.

&quot;But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I
took care to have a few of my sinners repent.&quot;

Mr. Dashwoods&#39;s editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had
forgotten her &#39;friend&#39;, and spoken as only an author could.

&quot;People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.  Morals don&#39;t
sell nowadays.&quot;  Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.

&quot;You think it would do with these alterations, then?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so
on,&quot; was Mr. Dashwood&#39;s affable reply.

&quot;What do you--that is, what compensation--&quot; began Jo, not exactly
knowing how to express herself.

&quot;Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this
sort.  Pay when it comes out,&quot; returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point
had escaped him.  Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.

&quot;Very well, you can have it,&quot; said Jo, handing back the story with a
satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five
seemed good pay.

&quot;Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better
than this?&quot; asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and
emboldened by her success.

&quot;Well, we&#39;ll look at it.  Can&#39;t promise to take it.  Tell her to make
it short and spicy, and never mind the moral.  What name would your
friend like to put on it?&quot; in a careless tone.

&quot;None at all, if you please, she doesn&#39;t wish her name to appear and
has no nom de plume,&quot; said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.

&quot;Just as she likes, of course.  The tale will be out next week. Will
you call for the money, or shall I send it?&quot; asked Mr. Dashwood, who
felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.

&quot;I&#39;ll call.  Good morning, Sir.&quot;

As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful
remark, &quot;Poor and proud, as usual, but she&#39;ll do.&quot;

Following Mr. Dashwood&#39;s directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her
model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational
literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,
she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.

Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and
scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared
upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit
as could be expected.  Her readers were not particular about such
trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood
graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not
thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his
hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher
wages, had basely left him in the lurch.

She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew
stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the
mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.  One
thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell
them at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not
approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon
afterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with
her stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but
promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.

She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write
nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of
conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show
her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.

But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could
not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,
history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and
lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found
that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the
tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business
light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic
energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them
original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers
for accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of
public librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in
the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.
She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old
that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,
and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought
she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to
desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman&#39;s character.
She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its
influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on
dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent
bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side
of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.

She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of
other people&#39;s passions and feelings set her to studying and
speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young
minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own
punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.

I don&#39;t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read
character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,
brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every
perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who
interested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one
of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and
lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a
writer.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and
studied him--a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he
known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.

Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither
rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called
fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a
genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as
about a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving
something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer
young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face
looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his
sake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last
decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had
any sorrow, &#39;it sat with its head under its wing&#39;, and he turned only
his sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but
Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to
others.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many
friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and
his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than
words.

His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the
wearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him
comfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart
underneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets
plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.
His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy
like other people&#39;s.

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that
genuine good will toward one&#39;s fellow men could beautify and dignify
even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own
socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.

Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine
respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the
Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,
and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much
honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came
to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss
Norton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked
it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud
to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor
language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much
beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.
Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most
unexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which
Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman
felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many
favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with
her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several
celebrities.

Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had
worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for
genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to
recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and
women after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid
admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on
&#39;spirit, fire, and dew&#39;, to behold him devouring his supper with an
ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a
fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her
romantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters
with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly
with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at
another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering
her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea
Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady
rendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting
their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting
themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young
musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked
horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be
the most ordinary man of the party.

Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,
that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined
her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the
philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an
intellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles
beyond Jo&#39;s comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel
were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,
and the only thing &#39;evolved from her inner consciousness&#39; was a bad
headache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the
world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,
according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,
that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and
intellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or
metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,
half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being
turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a
holiday.

She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him
looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.
He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated
just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,
trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after
they had annihilated all the old beliefs.

Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,
not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be
lightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,
attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit
his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul
would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over
that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.

He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an
opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion
with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken
English musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for
the wise men argued well, but he didn&#39;t know when he was beaten and
stood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got
right again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed
better than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was
not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid
ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but
not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.

She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor
her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out
then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.
She began to see that character is a better possession than money,
rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a
wise man has defined it to be, &#39;truth, reverence, and good will&#39;, then
her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.

This belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his
respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the
wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew
out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo
her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put
there and he had forgotten to take off.

&quot;It&#39;s evident he doesn&#39;t look in his glass before coming down,&quot; thought
Jo, with a smile, as he said &quot;Goot efening,&quot; and sat soberly down,
quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his
headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.

She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,
hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover
it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German
read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading
came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that
night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The
Professor didn&#39;t know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask
with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .

&quot;Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master&#39;s face? Haf you no
respect for me, that you go on so bad?&quot;

&quot;How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?&quot;
said Jo.

Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt
and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then
threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.

&quot;Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my
cap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,
you too shall wear him.&quot;

But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer
caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great
disgust, &quot;I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not
for children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I
haf no patience with those who make this harm.&quot;

Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a
lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but
the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but
fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It
was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if
it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no
name to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a
blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more
than people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among
the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he
asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it
occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it
troubled him.  He did not say to himself, &quot;It is none of my business.
I&#39;ve no right to say anything,&quot; as many people would have done.  He
only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from
mother&#39;s love and father&#39;s care, and he was moved to help her with an
impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out
his hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his
mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by
the time the paper was turned, and Jo&#39;s needle threaded, he was ready
to say quite naturally, but very gravely...

&quot;Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young
girls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I
would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad
trash.&quot;

&quot;All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for
it, I don&#39;t see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people
make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,&quot; said
Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits
followed her pin.

&quot;There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to
sell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would
not feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison
in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think
a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.&quot;

Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in
his hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for
her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and
gone harmlessly up the chimney.

&quot;I should like much to send all the rest after him,&quot; muttered the
Professor, coming back with a relieved air.

Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her
hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.
Then she thought consolingly to herself, &quot;Mine are not like that, they
are only silly, never bad, so I won&#39;t be worried,&quot; and taking up her
book, she said, with a studious face, &quot;Shall we go on, Sir? I&#39;ll be
very good and proper now.&quot;

&quot;I shall hope so,&quot; was all he said, but he meant more than she
imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the
words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.

As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully
reread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.
Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling
to see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed
to have on the Professor&#39;s mental or moral spectacles also, for the
faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her
with dismay.

&quot;They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is
more sensational than the last.  I&#39;ve gone blindly on, hurting myself
and other people, for the sake of money.  I know it&#39;s so, for I can&#39;t
read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,
and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of
them?&quot;

Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her
stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I&#39;d better
burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves
up with my gunpowder,&quot; she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura
whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.

But when nothing remained of all her three month&#39;s work except a heap
of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the
floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.

&quot;I think I haven&#39;t done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my
time,&quot; she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, &quot;I almost
wish I hadn&#39;t any conscience, it&#39;s so inconvenient.  If I didn&#39;t care
about doing right, and didn&#39;t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I
should get on capitally. I can&#39;t help wishing sometimes, that Mother
and Father hadn&#39;t been so particular about such things.&quot;

Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that &#39;Father and Mother were
particular&#39;, and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians
to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to
impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build
character upon in womanhood.

Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not
pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as
is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.
Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale
which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so
intensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the
beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease
in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and
cumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to
several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to
agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn&#39;t sell.

Then she tried a child&#39;s story, which she could easily have disposed of
if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.
The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try
juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to
convert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked
to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty
boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did
not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did
go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to
escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons
on their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo
corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...

&quot;I don&#39;t know anything.  I&#39;ll wait until I do before I try again, and
meantime, &#39;sweep mud in the street&#39; if I can&#39;t do better, that&#39;s
honest, at least.&quot;  Which decision proved that her second tumble down
the beanstalk had done her some good.

While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had
been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked
serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did
it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would
accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was
satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she
had given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the
second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her
evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and
studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on
occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.

He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was
happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons
besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her
own life.

It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.
Kirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The
children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer&#39;s hair stuck straight up all
over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.

&quot;Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,&quot; he said,
when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner,
while she held a little levee on that last evening.

She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when
his turn came, she said warmly, &quot;Now, Sir, you won&#39;t forget to come and
see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I&#39;ll never forgive you if
you do, for I want them all to know my friend.&quot;

&quot;Do you?  Shall I come?&quot; he asked, looking down at her with an eager
expression which she did not see.

&quot;Yes, come next month.  Laurie graduates then, and you&#39;d enjoy
commencement as something new.&quot;

&quot;That is your best friend, of whom you speak?&quot; he said in an altered
tone.

&quot;Yes, my boy Teddy.  I&#39;m very proud of him and should like you to see
him.&quot;

Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure
in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.
Bhaer&#39;s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more
than a &#39;best friend&#39;, and simply because she particularly wished not to
look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,
and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been
for Tina on her knee.  She didn&#39;t know what would have become of her.
Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her
face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and
his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual
expression, as he said cordially...

&quot;I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much
success, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!&quot;  And with that, he
shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.

But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the
tired look on his face and the &#39;heimweh&#39;, or homesickness, lying heavy
at his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little
child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head
on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search
of something that he could not find.

&quot;It is not for me, I must not hope it now,&quot; he said to himself, with a
sigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the
longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled
heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened
his Plato.

He did his best and did it manfully, but I don&#39;t think he found that a
pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very
satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.

Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and
thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory
of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her
company, and best of all, the happy thought, &quot;Well, the winter&#39;s gone,
and I&#39;ve written no books, earned no fortune, but I&#39;ve made a friend
worth having and I&#39;ll try to keep him all my life.&quot;



CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

HEARTACHE

Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose
that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with
the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his
friends said.  They were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr.
and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him
with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but
fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early
tomorrow.  You&#39;ll come and meet me as usual, girls?&quot; Laurie said, as he
put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.
He said &#39;girls&#39;, but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up
the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid,
successful boy anything, and answered warmly...

&quot;I&#39;ll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing &#39;Hail
the conquering hero comes&#39; on a jew&#39;s-harp.&quot;

Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,
&quot;Oh, deary me!  I know he&#39;ll say something, and then what shall I do?&quot;

Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and
having decided that she wouldn&#39;t be vain enough to think people were
going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her
answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy
wouldn&#39;t do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at
Meg&#39;s, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still
further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart
figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about
and run away.

&quot;Where&#39;s the jew&#39;s-harp, Jo?&quot; cried Laurie, as soon as he was within
speaking distance.

&quot;I forgot it.&quot; And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not
be called lover-like.

She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,
and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly
about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road
into the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he
walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now
and then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from
one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said
hastily, &quot;Now you must have a good long holiday!&quot;

&quot;I intend to.&quot;

Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him
looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded
moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, &quot;No,
Teddy.  Please don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;I will, and you must hear me.  It&#39;s no use, Jo, we&#39;ve got to have it
out, and the sooner the better for both of us,&quot; he answered, getting
flushed and excited all at once.

&quot;Say what you like then.  I&#39;ll listen,&quot; said Jo, with a desperate sort
of patience.

Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to &#39;have it
out&#39;, if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with
characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now
and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...

&quot;I&#39;ve loved you ever since I&#39;ve known you, Jo, couldn&#39;t help it, you&#39;ve
been so good to me.  I&#39;ve tried to show it, but you wouldn&#39;t let me.
Now I&#39;m going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can&#39;t go
on so any longer.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to save you this.  I thought you&#39;d understand...&quot; began Jo,
finding it a great deal harder than she expected.

&quot;I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they
mean.  They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits
just for the fun of it,&quot; returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an
undeniable fact.

&quot;I don&#39;t.  I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away
to keep you from it if I could.&quot;

&quot;I thought so.  It was like you, but it was no use.  I only loved you
all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards
and everything you didn&#39;t like, and waited and never complained, for I
hoped you&#39;d love me, though I&#39;m not half good enough...&quot; Here there was
a choke that couldn&#39;t be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while
he cleared his &#39;confounded throat&#39;.

&quot;You, you are, you&#39;re a great deal too good for me, and I&#39;m so grateful
to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t love you
as you want me to.  I&#39;ve tried, but I can&#39;t change the feeling, and it
would be a lie to say I do when I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Really, truly, Jo?&quot;

He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with
a look that she did not soon forget.

&quot;Really, truly, dear.&quot;

They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words
fell reluctantly from Jo&#39;s lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as
if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him.
So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still
that Jo was frightened.

&quot;Oh, Teddy, I&#39;m sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it
would do any good!  I wish you wouldn&#39;t take it so hard, I can&#39;t help
it.  You know it&#39;s impossible for people to make themselves love other
people if they don&#39;t,&quot; cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she
softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted
her so long ago.

&quot;They do sometimes,&quot; said a muffled voice from the post. &quot;I don&#39;t
believe it&#39;s the right sort of love, and I&#39;d rather not try it,&quot; was
the decided answer.

There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow
by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said
very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, &quot;Laurie, I want
to tell you something.&quot;

He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in
a fierce tone, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me that, Jo, I can&#39;t bear it now!&quot;

&quot;Tell what?&quot; she asked, wondering at his violence.

&quot;That you love that old man.&quot;

&quot;What old man?&quot; demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.

&quot;That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you
love him, I know I shall do something desperate;&quot; and he looked as if
he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark
in his eyes.

Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she
too, was getting excited with all this, &quot;Don&#39;t swear, Teddy!  He isn&#39;t
old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I&#39;ve got,
next to you.  Pray, don&#39;t fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I
know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor.  I haven&#39;t the least
idea of loving him or anybody else.&quot;

&quot;But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this
trouble.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t love anyone else, and I&#39;ll never forget you, Jo, Never!
Never!&quot; with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.

&quot;What shall I do with him?&quot; sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more
unmanagable than she expected.  &quot;You haven&#39;t heard what I wanted to
tell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make
you happy,&quot; she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which
proved that she knew nothing about love.

Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on
the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,
and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was
not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo&#39;s part, for how
could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes
full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or
two her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his
head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed
to grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure! &quot;I agree with
Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick
tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we
were so foolish as to...&quot; Jo paused a little over the last word, but
Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.

&quot;Marry--no we shouldn&#39;t!  If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect
saint, for you could make me anything you like.&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#39;t.  I&#39;ve tried and failed, and I won&#39;t risk our happiness by
such a serious experiment.  We don&#39;t agree and we never shall, so we&#39;ll
be good friends all our lives, but we won&#39;t go and do anything rash.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we will if we get the chance,&quot; muttered Laurie rebelliously.

&quot;Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,&quot; implored
Jo, almost at her wit&#39;s end.

&quot;I won&#39;t be reasonable.  I don&#39;t want to take what you call &#39;a sensible
view&#39;.  It won&#39;t help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don&#39;t believe
you&#39;ve got any heart.&quot;

&quot;I wish I hadn&#39;t.&quot;

There was a little quiver in Jo&#39;s voice, and thinking it a good omen,
Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he
said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously
wheedlesome before, &quot;Don&#39;t disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it.
Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can&#39;t get
on without you.  Say you will, and let&#39;s be happy.  Do, do!&quot;

Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength
of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided
that she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to
do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.

&quot;I can&#39;t say &#39;yes&#39; truly, so I won&#39;t say it at all.  You&#39;ll see that
I&#39;m right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...&quot; she began solemnly.

&quot;I&#39;ll be hanged if I do!&quot; and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning
with indignation at the very idea.

&quot;Yes, you will!&quot; persisted Jo.  &quot;You&#39;ll get over this after a while,
and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a
fine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m homely and awkward
and odd and old, and you&#39;d be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we
can&#39;t help it even now, you see--and I shouldn&#39;t like elegant society
and you would, and you&#39;d hate my scribbling, and I couldn&#39;t get on
without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn&#39;t done it, and
everything would be horrid!&quot;

&quot;Anything more?&quot; asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to
this prophetic burst.

&quot;Nothing more, except that I don&#39;t believe I shall ever marry.  I&#39;m
happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it
up for any mortal man.&quot;

&quot;I know better!&quot; broke in Laurie.  &quot;You think so now, but there&#39;ll come
a time when you will care for somebody, and you&#39;ll love him
tremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it&#39;s your
way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,&quot; and the despairing lover
cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed
comical, if his face had not been so tragic.

&quot;Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love
him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!&quot; cried Jo,
losing patience with poor Teddy.  &quot;I&#39;ve done my best, but you won&#39;t be
reasonable, and it&#39;s selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can&#39;t
give.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,
but I&#39;ll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for
both of us--so now!&quot;

That speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he
did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,
saying in a desperate sort of tone, &quot;You&#39;ll be sorry some day, Jo.&quot;

&quot;Oh, where are you going?&quot; she cried, for his face frightened her.

&quot;To the devil!&quot; was the consoling answer.

For a minute Jo&#39;s heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank
toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a
young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort
who are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a
melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and
coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time
up the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and
unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip
the trouble which he carried in his heart.

&quot;That will do him good, and he&#39;ll come home in such a tender, penitent
state of mind, that I shan&#39;t dare to see him,&quot; she said, adding, as she
went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,
and buried it under the leaves.  &quot;Now I must go and prepare Mr.
Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he&#39;d love Beth,
perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.
Oh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think
it&#39;s dreadful.&quot;

Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went
straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then
broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind
old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.
He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving
Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better
than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and
resolved to carry his boy out of harm&#39;s way, for Young Impetuosity&#39;s
parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.

When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather
met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very
successfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the
twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the
old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to
listen to praises of the last year&#39;s success, which to him now seemed
like love&#39;s labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to
his piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking
in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her
sister, for he played the &#39;_Sonata Pathetique_&#39;, and played it as he
never did before.

&quot;That&#39;s very fine, I dare say, but it&#39;s sad enough to make one cry.
Give us something gayer, lad,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart
was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.

Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several
minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull
Mrs. March&#39;s voice had not been heard calling, &quot;Jo, dear, come in.  I
want you.&quot;

Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he
listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and
the musician sat silent in the dark.

&quot;I can&#39;t stand this,&quot; muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped
his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad
shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, &quot;I know, my boy, I know.&quot;

No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, &quot;Who told you?&quot;

&quot;Jo herself.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s an end of it!&quot;  And he shook off his grandfather&#39;s hands
with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his
man&#39;s pride could not bear a man&#39;s pity.

&quot;Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of
it,&quot; returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. &quot;You won&#39;t care to
stay at home now, perhaps?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t intend to run away from a girl.  Jo can&#39;t prevent my seeing
her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,&quot; interrupted Laurie
in a defiant tone.

&quot;Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I&#39;m disappointed, but the
girl can&#39;t help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away
for a time.  Where will you go?&quot;

&quot;Anywhere.  I don&#39;t care what becomes of me,&quot; and Laurie got up with a
reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather&#39;s ear.

&quot;Take it like a man, and don&#39;t do anything rash, for God&#39;s sake.  Why
not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;ve been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got
through college.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but I didn&#39;t mean to go alone!&quot; and Laurie walked fast through the
room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.

&quot;I don&#39;t ask you to go alone.  There&#39;s someone ready and glad to go
with you, anywhere in the world.&quot;

&quot;Who, Sir?&quot; stopping to listen.

&quot;Myself.&quot;

Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying
huskily, &quot;I&#39;m a selfish brute, but--you know--Grandfather--&quot;

&quot;Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I&#39;ve been through it all before,
once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,
just sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It&#39;s all settled, and can be
carried out at once,&quot; said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,
as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before
him.

&quot;Well, sir, what is it?&quot; and Laurie sat down, without a sign of
interest in face or voice.

&quot;There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you
should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here
will get on very well with Brooke to manage them.  My partners do
almost everything, I&#39;m merely holding on until you take my place, and
can be off at any time.&quot;

&quot;But you hate traveling, Sir.  I can&#39;t ask it of you at your age,&quot;
began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to
go alone, if he went at all.

The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to
prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him
that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.  So,
stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would
leave behind him, he said stoutly, &quot;Bless your soul, I&#39;m not
superannuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea.  It will do me good, and my
old bones won&#39;t suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as
sitting in a chair.&quot;

A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy,
or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, &quot;I
don&#39;t mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you&#39;d feel
happier than if I was left behind.  I don&#39;t intend to gad about with
you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in
my own way.  I&#39;ve friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit
them.  Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you
will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your
heart&#39;s content.&quot;

Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the
world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the
old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken
heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly
appeared in the howling wilderness.  He sighed, and then said, in a
spiritless tone, &quot;Just as you like, Sir.  It doesn&#39;t matter where I go
or what I do.&quot;

&quot;It does to me, remember that, my lad.  I give you entire liberty, but
I trust you to make an honest use of it.  Promise me that, Laurie.&quot;

&quot;Anything you like, Sir.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; thought the old gentleman.  &quot;You don&#39;t care now, but there&#39;ll
come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I&#39;m
much mistaken.&quot;

Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was
hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,
they were off.  During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore
himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases.  He was moody,
irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress
and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided
Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a
tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a
heavy sense of guilt by day.  Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of
his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to
attempt consolation or offer sympathy.  On some accounts, this was a
relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very
uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the &#39;poor, dear fellow was
going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy&#39;.  Of course, he
smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad
superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was
unalterable.

When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain
inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.  This
gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did
for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with
a whisper full of motherly solicitude.  Then feeling that he was going
very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the
afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life.  Jo followed a
minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round.  He did look
round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above
him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal
eloquent and pathetic.

&quot;Oh, Jo, can&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Teddy, dear, I wish I could!&quot;

That was all, except a little pause.  Then Laurie straightened himself
up, said, &quot;It&#39;s all right, never mind,&quot; and went away without another
word.  Ah, but it wasn&#39;t all right, and Jo did mind, for while the
curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as
if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a
look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.



CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

BETH&#39;S SECRET

When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in
Beth.  No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too
gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by
absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo&#39;s heart as she
saw her sister&#39;s face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in
the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if
the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining
through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.  Jo saw
and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first
impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one
appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo
for a time forgot her fear.

But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety
returned and haunted her.  She had confessed her sins and been
forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip,
Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from
home.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and
as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took
Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open
air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale
cheeks.

It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people
there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.
Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care
for anyone else.  So they were all in all to each other, and came and
went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about
them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the
feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long
separation was not far away.

They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves
and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is
very hard to overcome.  Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her
heart and Beth&#39;s, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there
seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to
speak.  She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not
seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows
grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home,
believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She
wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and
what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when
she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo&#39;s lap, while the winds
blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.

One day Beth told her.  Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still,
and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying
to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth&#39;s cheeks.  But she
could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,
and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells
they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever
that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively
tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a
minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth
was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for
her to say, &quot;Jo, dear, I&#39;m glad you know it.  I&#39;ve tried to tell you,
but I couldn&#39;t.&quot;

There was no answer except her sister&#39;s cheek against her own, not even
tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry.  She was the weaker
then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about
her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.

&quot;I&#39;ve known it for a good while, dear, and now I&#39;m used to it, it isn&#39;t
hard to think of or to bear.  Try to see it so and don&#39;t be troubled
about me, because it&#39;s best, indeed it is.&quot;

&quot;Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel
it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?&quot; asked Jo, refusing
to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no
part in Beth&#39;s trouble.

&quot;Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn&#39;t like to own it. I tried to
think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone.  But
when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was
hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,
Jo.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Beth, and you didn&#39;t tell me, didn&#39;t let me comfort and help you?
How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?&quot;

Jo&#39;s voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of
the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say
goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.

&quot;Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.  I wasn&#39;t sure, no one
said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.  It would have been selfish
to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,
and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then.&quot;

&quot;And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I
couldn&#39;t,&quot; cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.

Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,
and added softly, &quot;Then you didn&#39;t, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and
imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.&quot;

&quot;Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?&quot; asked Beth, as
innocently as a child.  &quot;I do love him dearly.  He is so good to me,
how can I help It?  But he could never be anything to me but my
brother.  I hope he truly will be, sometime.&quot;

&quot;Not through me,&quot; said Jo decidedly.  &quot;Amy is left for him, and they
would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now.  I
don&#39;t care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.&quot;

&quot;I want to, oh, so much!  I try, but every day I lose a little, and
feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.  It&#39;s like the tide,
Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can&#39;t be stopped.&quot;

&quot;It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too
young, Beth.  I can&#39;t let you go.  I&#39;ll work and pray and fight against
it.  I&#39;ll keep you in spite of everything.  There must be ways, it
can&#39;t be too late.  God won&#39;t be so cruel as to take you from me,&quot;
cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously
submissive than Beth&#39;s.

Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows
itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than
homilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the
faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and
cheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no
questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of
us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and
strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come.  She
did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her
passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,
from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He
draws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, &quot;I&#39;m glad to go,&quot; for
life was very sweet for her.  She could only sob out, &quot;I try to be
willing,&quot; while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this
great sorrow broke over them together.

By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, &quot;You&#39;ll tell them this
when we go home?&quot;

&quot;I think they will see it without words,&quot; sighed Jo, for now it seemed
to her that Beth changed every day.

&quot;Perhaps not.  I&#39;ve heard that the people who love best are often
blindest to such things.  If they don&#39;t see it, you will tell them for
me.  I don&#39;t want any secrets, and it&#39;s kinder to prepare them.  Meg
has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father
and Mother, won&#39;t you Jo?&quot;

&quot;If I can.  But, Beth, I don&#39;t give up yet.  I&#39;m going to believe that
it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it&#39;s true.&quot; said Jo, trying
to speak cheerfully.

Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, &quot;I don&#39;t
know how to express myself, and shouldn&#39;t try to anyone but you,
because I can&#39;t speak out except to my Jo.  I only mean to say that I
have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long.  I&#39;m not
like the rest of you.  I never made any plans about what I&#39;d do when I
grew up.  I never thought of being married, as you all did.  I couldn&#39;t
seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about
at home, of no use anywhere but there.  I never wanted to go away, and
the hard part now is the leaving you all.  I&#39;m not afraid, but it seems
as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.&quot;

Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the
sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.  A white-winged gull flew
by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast.  Beth watched it
till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little
gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach &#39;peeping&#39; softly to
itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea.  It came quite close to Beth,
and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,
dressing its wet feathers, quite at home.  Beth smiled and felt
comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and
remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.

&quot;Dear little bird!  See, Jo, how tame it is.  I like peeps better than
the gulls.  They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,
confiding little things.  I used to call them my birds last summer, and
Mother said they reminded her of me--busy, quaker-colored creatures,
always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song
of theirs.  You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm
and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.  Meg is the
turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up
among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again.  Dear
little girl!  She&#39;s so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and
no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home.  I hope I
shall see her again, but she seems so far away.&quot;

&quot;She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to
see and enjoy her.  I&#39;m going to have you well and rosy by that time,&quot;
began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change
was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought
aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.

&quot;Jo, dear, don&#39;t hope any more.  It won&#39;t do any good.  I&#39;m sure of
that.  We won&#39;t be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait.
We&#39;ll have happy times, for I don&#39;t suffer much, and I think the tide
will go out easily, if you help me.&quot;

Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss,
she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.

She was right.  There was no need of any words when they got home, for
Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from
seeing.  Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying
how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she
would be spared the hard task of telling Beth&#39;s secret.  Her father
stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came
in, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went
to comfort her without a word.



CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN

NEW IMPRESSIONS

At three o&#39;clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice
may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place, for the
wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is
bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined
with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills.
Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes
worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a
carnival.  Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome
Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all
drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing
the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor
Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.  The equipages are as
varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low
basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of
dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from
overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch
behind.

Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with
his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.
He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the
independent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry pairs
of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in
black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange
flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy
him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the
young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at
some blonde girl in blue.  Presently he strolled out of the promenade
and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and
listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach
toward Castle Hill.  The quick trot of ponies&#39; feet made him look up,
as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came
rapidly down the street.  The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in
blue.  He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his
hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.

&quot;Oh, Laurie, is it really you?  I thought you&#39;d never come!&quot; cried Amy,
dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great
scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter&#39;s steps,
lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these
&#39;mad English&#39;.

&quot;I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,
and here I am.&quot;

&quot;How is your grandfather?  When did you come?  Where are you staying?&quot;

&quot;Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.  I called at your hotel, but
you were out.&quot;

&quot;I have so much to say, I don&#39;t know where to begin!  Get in and we can
talk at our ease.  I was going for a drive and longing for company.
Flo&#39;s saving up for tonight.&quot;

&quot;What happens then, a ball?&quot;

&quot;A Christmas party at our hotel.  There are many Americans there, and
they give it in honor of the day.  You&#39;ll go with us, of course?  Aunt
will be charmed.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.  Where now?&quot; asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his
arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her
parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies&#39; backs afforded her
infinite satisfaction.

&quot;I&#39;m going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill.
The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever
been there?&quot;

&quot;Often, years ago, but I don&#39;t mind having a look at it.&quot;

&quot;Now tell me all about yourself.  The last I heard of you, your
grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has
settled for the winter.  He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse
him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a sociable arrangement,&quot; said Amy, missing something in
Laurie&#39;s manner, though she couldn&#39;t tell what.

&quot;Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each
suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.  I am often with him, and he
enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see
me when I get back from my wanderings.  Dirty old hole, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he
added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the
Place Napoleon in the old city.

&quot;The dirt is picturesque, so I don&#39;t mind.  The river and the hills are
delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my
delight.  Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass.  It&#39;s
going to the Church of St.  John.&quot;

While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their
canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some
brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt
a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could
not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside
her.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but
now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired
and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver
than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She
couldn&#39;t understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she
shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away
across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.

&quot;Que pensez-vous?&quot; she said, airing her French, which had improved in
quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.

&quot;That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is
charming,&quot; replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an
admiring look.

She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy
her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he
promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was
&#39;altogether jolly&#39;, with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the
head.  She didn&#39;t like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded
indifferent in spite of the look.

&quot;If that&#39;s the way he&#39;s going to grow up, I wish he&#39;d stay a boy,&quot; she
thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying
meantime to seem quite easy and gay.

At Avigdor&#39;s she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins
to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road
between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.

&quot;Beth is very poorly, Mother says.  I often think I ought to go home,
but they all say &#39;stay&#39;.  So I do, for I shall never have another
chance like this,&quot; said Amy, looking sober over one page.

&quot;I think you are right, there.  You could do nothing at home, and it is
a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and
enjoying so much, my dear.&quot;

He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said
that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy&#39;s heart was lightened,
for the look, the act, the brotherly &#39;my dear&#39;, seemed to assure her
that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.
Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her
scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing
from her mouth the words, &#39;Genius burns!&#39;.

Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket &#39;to keep it from
blowing away&#39;, and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read
him.

&quot;This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the
morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,&quot; said
Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of
splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.
While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs
to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,
with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had
wrought.  He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and
approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and
manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of
that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call
elegance.  Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb
in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman
of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed
itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness
was unspoiled by foreign polish.

Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,
but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a
pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,
which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her
cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure
in the pleasant scene.

As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved
her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing
here and there, &quot;Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the
fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa
Franca, Schubert&#39;s Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far
out to sea which they say is Corsica?&quot;

&quot;I remember.  It&#39;s not much changed,&quot; he answered without enthusiasm.

&quot;What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!&quot; said Amy,
feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.

&quot;Yes,&quot; was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the
island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting
in his sight.

&quot;Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what
you have been doing with yourself all this while,&quot; said Amy, seating
herself, ready for a good talk.

But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her
questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the
Continent and been to Greece.  So after idling away an hour, they drove
home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left
them, promising to return in the evening.

It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night.
Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had
seen her old friend in a new light, not as &#39;our boy&#39;, but as a handsome
and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to
find favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most
of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and
pretty woman.

Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them
on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple
dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh
flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were
both inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist
sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique
coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear
heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon
such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep
our hearts merry with their artless vanities.

&quot;I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,&quot; said
Amy to herself, as she put on Flo&#39;s old white silk ball dress, and
covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white
shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair
she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and
curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.

&quot;It&#39;s not the fashion, but it&#39;s becoming, and I can&#39;t afford to make a
fright of myself,&quot; she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or
braid, as the latest style commanded.

Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped
her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white
shoulders in delicate green vines.  Remembering the painted boots, she
surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and
chassed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.

&quot;My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the
real lace on Aunt&#39;s mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only
had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,&quot; she said,
surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.

In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as
she glided away.  She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she
thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate
than the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon
while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the
chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought
better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed
of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so
happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came
in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant
window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,
the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as
a well-placed statue.

&quot;Good evening, Diana!&quot; said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she
liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.

&quot;Good evening, Apollo!&quot; she answered, smiling back at him, for he too
looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on
the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain
Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.

&quot;Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you
didn&#39;t like what Hannah calls a &#39;sot-bookay&#39;,&quot; said Laurie, handing her
a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily
passed it in Cardiglia&#39;s window.

&quot;How kind you are!&quot; she exclaimed gratefully.  &quot;If I&#39;d known you were
coming I&#39;d have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty
as this, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.  It isn&#39;t what it should be, but you have improved it,&quot; he
added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.

&quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I thought you liked that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;Not from you, it doesn&#39;t sound natural, and I like your old bluntness
better.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of it,&quot; he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her
gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to
do when they went to parties together at home.

The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was
such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.  The hospitable
Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having
no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their
Christmas ball.

A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk
with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet&#39;s mother in black velvet with
a pearl bridle under her chin.  A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted
himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, &#39;a fascinating dear&#39;, and a
German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely
about, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild&#39;s private
secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the
world, as if his master&#39;s name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout
Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,
and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little
family of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,
shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,
and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set
of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while
mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly
when they danced with their daughters.

Any young girl can imagine Amy&#39;s state of mind when she &#39;took the
stage&#39; that night, leaning on Laurie&#39;s arm.  She knew she looked well,
she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a
ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when
young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to
rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis
girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim
papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her
friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it
permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who
her distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the
band, Amy&#39;s color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap
the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know
it.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than
described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, &quot;Do you care to
dance?&quot;

&quot;One usually does at a ball.&quot;

Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as
fast as possible.

&quot;I meant the first dance.  May I have the honor?&quot;

&quot;I can give you one if I put off the Count.  He dances divinely, but he
will excuse me, as you are an old friend,&quot; said Amy, hoping that the
name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be
trifled with.

&quot;Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...

    A daughter of the gods,
    Devinely tall, and most divinely fair,&quot;

was all the satisfaction she got, however.

The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy
was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the
while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie
resigned her to the &#39;nice little boy&#39;, and went to do his duty to Flo,
without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of
forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself
till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She
showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled
instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka
redowa.  But his polite regrets didn&#39;t impose upon her, and when she
galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with
an actual expression of relief.

That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long
while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between
the dances for a necessary pin or a moment&#39;s rest.  Her anger had a
good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed
unusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie&#39;s eyes followed her with
pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit
and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very
naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before
the evening was half over, had decided that &#39;little Amy was going to
make a very charming woman&#39;.

It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took
possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,
hearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and
banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who
couldn&#39;t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was
dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young
giraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor
with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin
train.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating
steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the
ravages he committed.  But the Emperor&#39;s friend covered himself with
glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and
introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The
boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he
&#39;carried weight&#39;, he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he
flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails
waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the
music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his
fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.

Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more
graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time
to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as
indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished
her, with assurances that he was &#39;desolated to leave so early&#39;, she was
ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.

It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections
find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young
blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the
enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up
look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring
her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, &quot;Ah, I
thought that would do him good!&quot;

&quot;You look like Balzac&#39;s &#39;_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_&#39;,&quot; he said, as he
fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.

&quot;My rouge won&#39;t come off.&quot; and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and
showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh
outright.

&quot;What do you call this stuff?&quot; he asked, touching a fold of her dress
that had blown over his knee.

&quot;Illusion.&quot;

&quot;Good name for it.  It&#39;s very pretty--new thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s as old as the hills.  You have seen it on dozens of girls, and
you never found out that it was pretty till now--stupide!&quot;

&quot;I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.&quot;

&quot;None of that, it is forbidden.  I&#39;d rather take coffee than
compliments just now.  No, don&#39;t lounge, it makes me nervous.&quot;

Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd
sort of pleasure in having &#39;little Amy&#39; order him about, for she had
lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him,
as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any
signs of subjection.

&quot;Where did you learn all this sort of thing?&quot; he asked with a quizzical
look.

&quot;As &#39;this sort of thing&#39; is rather a vague expression, would you kindly
explain?&quot; returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but
wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.

&quot;Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,
the--the--illusion--you know&quot;, laughed Laurie, breaking down and
helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.

Amy was gratified, but of course didn&#39;t show it, and demurely answered,
&quot;Foreign life polishes one in spite of one&#39;s self.  I study as well as
play, and as for this&quot;--with a little gesture toward her dress--&quot;why,
tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making
the most of my poor little things.&quot;

Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn&#39;t in good
taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both
admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of
opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.
Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up
her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of
the evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought
this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions
which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.



CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT

ON THE SHELF

In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,
when &#39;Vive la liberte!&#39; becomes their motto.  In America, as everyone
knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy
their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually
abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion
almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.
Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as
soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim,
as did a very pretty woman the other day, &quot;I&#39;m as handsome as ever, but
no one takes any notice of me because I&#39;m married.&quot;

Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience
this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little
world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired
and beloved than ever.

As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very
strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter
exclusion of everything and everybody else.  Day and night she brooded
over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the
tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the
kitchen department.  Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the
wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored
his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time,
supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.
But three months passed, and there was no return of repose.  Meg looked
worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the
house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life &#39;aisy&#39;, kept
him on short commons.  When he went out in the morning he was
bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily
in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a &quot;Hush!
They are just asleep after worrying all day.&quot;  If he proposed a little
amusement at home, &quot;No, it would disturb the babies.&quot;  If he hinted at
a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a
decided--&quot;Leave my children for pleasure, never!&quot;  His sleep was broken
by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to
and fro in the watches of the night.  His meals were interrupted by the
frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped,
if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above.  And when he read his
paper of an evening, Demi&#39;s colic got into the shipping list and
Daisy&#39;s fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only
interested in domestic news.

The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of
his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual &#39;hushing&#39; made
him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred
precincts of Babyland.  He bore it very patiently for six months, and
when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles
do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere.  Scott had married and
gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running
over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty,
and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.  Mrs.
Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,
and she performed her mission most successfully.  The parlor was always
bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty
of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.

John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so
lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and
enjoyed his neighbor&#39;s society.

Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a
relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in
the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children.  But
by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep
at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John,
and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite
in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the
fender.  She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured
because he did not know that she wanted him without being told,
entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain.
She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that
unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally
experience when domestic cares oppress them.  Want of exercise robs
them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American
women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no
muscle.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she would say, looking in the glass, &quot;I&#39;m getting old and ugly.
John doesn&#39;t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded
wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances.
Well, the babies love me, they don&#39;t care if I am thin and pale and
haven&#39;t time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John
will see what I&#39;ve gladly sacrificed for them, won&#39;t he, my precious?&quot;

To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a
crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which
soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as
politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss
interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.
Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one
day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg&#39;s drooping
spirits had not escaped her observation.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need
advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed,&quot;
replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy&#39;s bib with an injured
air.

&quot;Goes on how, my dear?&quot; asked her mother anxiously.

&quot;He&#39;s away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is
continually going over to the Scotts&#39;.  It isn&#39;t fair that I should
have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish,
even the best of them.&quot;

&quot;So are women.  Don&#39;t blame John till you see where you are wrong
yourself.&quot;

&quot;But it can&#39;t be right for him to neglect me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you neglect him?&quot;

&quot;Why, Mother, I thought you&#39;d take my part!&quot;

&quot;So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours,
Meg.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see how.&quot;

&quot;Let me show you.  Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you
made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only
leisure time?&quot;

&quot;No, but I can&#39;t do it now, with two babies to tend.&quot;

&quot;I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.  May I speak quite
freely, and will you remember that it&#39;s Mother who blames as well as
Mother who sympathizes?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I will!  Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often
feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to
me for everything.&quot;

Meg drew her low chair beside her mother&#39;s, and with a little
interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly
together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than
ever.

&quot;You have only made the mistake that most young wives make--forgotten
your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very
natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be
remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw
you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and
John had nothing to do but support them.  I&#39;ve seen it for some weeks,
but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid it won&#39;t.  If I ask him to stay, he&#39;ll think I&#39;m jealous,
and I wouldn&#39;t insult him by such an idea.  He doesn&#39;t see that I want
him, and I don&#39;t know how to tell him without words.&quot;

&quot;Make it so pleasant he won&#39;t want to go away.  My dear, he&#39;s longing
for his little home, but it isn&#39;t home without you, and you are always
in the nursery.&quot;

&quot;Oughtn&#39;t I to be there?&quot;

&quot;Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you
are unfitted for everything.  Besides, you owe something to John as
well as to the babies.  Don&#39;t neglect husband for children, don&#39;t shut
him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.  His place is
there as well as yours, and the children need him.  Let him feel that
he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it
will be better for you all.&quot;

&quot;You really think so, Mother?&quot;

&quot;I know it, Meg, for I&#39;ve tried it, and I seldom give advice unless
I&#39;ve proved its practicability.  When you and Jo were little, I went on
just as you are, feeling as if I didn&#39;t do my duty unless I devoted
myself wholly to you.  Poor Father took to his books, after I had
refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone.  I
struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me.  I
nearly spoiled her by indulgence.  You were poorly, and I worried about
you till I fell sick myself.  Then Father came to the rescue, quietly
managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake,
and never have been able to get on without him since.  That is the
secret of our home happiness.  He does not let business wean him from
the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let
domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits.  Each do our part
alone in many things, but at home we work together, always.&quot;

&quot;It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and
children what you have been to yours.  Show me how, I&#39;ll do anything
you say.&quot;

&quot;You always were my docile daughter.  Well, dear, if I were you, I&#39;d
let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs
training, and it&#39;s none too soon to begin. Then I&#39;d do what I have
often proposed, let Hannah come and help you.  She is a capital nurse,
and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more
housework.  You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and
John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as
busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get
dismal there is no fair weather.  Then I&#39;d try to take an interest in
whatever John likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange
ideas, and help each other in that way.  Don&#39;t shut yourself up in a
bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and
educate yourself to take your part in the world&#39;s work, for it all
affects you and yours.&quot;

&quot;John is so sensible, I&#39;m afraid he will think I&#39;m stupid if I ask
questions about politics and things.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe he would.  Love covers a multitude of sins, and of
whom could you ask more freely than of him?  Try it, and see if he
doesn&#39;t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott&#39;s suppers.&quot;

&quot;I will.  Poor John!  I&#39;m afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I
thought I was right, and he never said anything.&quot;

&quot;He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy.
This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow
apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the
first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it.
And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years
of the little lives given to them to train.  Don&#39;t let John be a
stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and
happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and
through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.
Now, dear, good-by.  Think over Mother&#39;s preachment, act upon it if it
seems good, and God bless you all.&quot;

Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the
first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it.  Of
course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as
they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they
wanted.  Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not
so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by
an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi
inherited a trifle of his sire&#39;s firmness of character, we won&#39;t call
it obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do
anything, all the king&#39;s horses and all the king&#39;s men could not change
that pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be
taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was
too soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when
he undertook to &#39;wrastle&#39; with &#39;Parpar&#39;, he always got the worst of it,
yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and
loved the father whose grave &quot;No, no,&quot; was more impressive than all
Mamma&#39;s love pats.

A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social
evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in
order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early,
that nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately
Demi&#39;s most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that
night he decided to go on a rampage.  So poor Meg sang and rocked, told
stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all
in vain, the big eyes wouldn&#39;t shut, and long after Daisy had gone to
byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty
Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake
expression of countenance.

&quot;Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives
poor Papa his tea?&quot; asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the
well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.

&quot;Me has tea!&quot; said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.

&quot;No, but I&#39;ll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you&#39;ll go
bye-bye like Daisy.  Will you, lovey?&quot;

&quot;Iss!&quot; and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the
desired day.

Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran
down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow
in her hair which was his especial admiration.  He saw it at once and
said with pleased surprise, &quot;Why, little mother, how gay we are
tonight.  Do you expect company?&quot;

&quot;Only you, dear.&quot;

&quot;Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change.  You always
make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why
shouldn&#39;t I when I have the time?&quot;

&quot;I do it out of respect for you, my dear,&quot; said old-fashioned John.

&quot;Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,&quot; laughed Meg, looking young and pretty
again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s altogether delightful, and like old times.  This tastes
right.  I drink your health, dear.&quot; and John sipped his tea with an air
of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as
he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little
voice was heard, saying impatiently...

&quot;Opy doy.  Me&#39;s tummin!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s that naughty boy.  I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he
is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,&quot;
said Meg, answering the call.

&quot;Mornin&#39; now,&quot; announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his
long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing
gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the &#39;cakies&#39; with loving
glances.

&quot;No, it isn&#39;t morning yet.  You must go to bed, and not trouble poor
Mamma.  Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.&quot;

&quot;Me loves Parpar,&quot; said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal
knee and revel in forbidden joys.  But John shook his head, and said to
Meg...

&quot;If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do
it, or he will never learn to mind you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course.  Come, Demi,&quot;  and Meg led her son away, feeling a
strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,
laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as
soon as they reached the nursery.

Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him
a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more
promenades till morning.

&quot;Iss!&quot; said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and
regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.

Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when
the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies
by boldly demanding, &quot;More sudar, Marmar.&quot;

&quot;Now this won&#39;t do,&quot; said John, hardening his heart against the
engaging little sinner.  &quot;We shall never know any peace till that child
learns to go to bed properly.  You have made a slave of yourself long
enough.  Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it.  Put
him in his bed and leave him, Meg.&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll manage him.  Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma
bids you.&quot;

&quot;S&#39;ant!&quot; replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted
&#39;cakie&#39;, and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.

&quot;You must never say that to Papa.  I shall carry you if you don&#39;t go
yourself.&quot;

&quot;Go &#39;way, me don&#39;t love Parpar.&quot; and Demi retired to his mother&#39;s
skirts for protection.

But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to
the enemy, with a &quot;Be gentle with him, John,&quot; which struck the culprit
with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at
hand.  Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a
strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his
wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the
way upstairs.  The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled
out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously
caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which
lively performance was kept up till the young man&#39;s strength gave out,
when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice.  This vocal
exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post
which is popularly believed to be deaf.  No coaxing, no sugar, no
lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of
the fire enlivened the &#39;big dark&#39; which Demi regarded with curiosity
rather than fear.  This new order of things disgusted him, and he
howled dismally for &#39;Marmar&#39;, as his angry passions subsided, and
recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.
The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg&#39;s
heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...

&quot;Let me stay with him, he&#39;ll be good now, John.&quot;

&quot;No, my dear.  I&#39;ve told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and
he must, if I stay here all night.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;ll cry himself sick,&quot; pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for
deserting her boy.

&quot;No, he won&#39;t, he&#39;s so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter
is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind.  Don&#39;t
interfere, I&#39;ll manage him.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s my child, and I can&#39;t have his spirit broken by harshness.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s my child, and I won&#39;t have his temper spoiled by indulgence.  Go
down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.&quot;

When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never
regretted her docility.

&quot;Please let me kiss him once, John?&quot;

&quot;Certainly.  Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest,
for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.&quot;

Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it
was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom
of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.

&quot;Poor little man, he&#39;s worn out with sleep and crying.  I&#39;ll cover him
up, and then go and set Meg&#39;s heart at rest,&quot; thought John, creeping to
the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.

But he wasn&#39;t, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi&#39;s eyes
opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying
with a penitent hiccough, &quot;Me&#39;s dood, now.&quot;

Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which
followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible
accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi
lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a
subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father&#39;s arm and
holding his father&#39;s finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered
with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,
John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed
its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that
tussle with his son than with his whole day&#39;s work.

As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to
herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, &quot;I
never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does
know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting
too much for me.&quot;

When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful
wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a
bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the
election, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a
revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,
knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn&#39;t
keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon
appear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then
explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply
interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from
wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In
her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as
mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling
each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and
when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought
diplomatic ambiguity, &quot;Well, I really don&#39;t see what we are coming to.&quot;

John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty
little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it
with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.

&quot;She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I&#39;ll try and like
millinery for hers, that&#39;s only fair,&quot; thought John the Just, adding
aloud, &quot;That&#39;s very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?&quot;

&quot;My dear man, it&#39;s a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater
bonnet.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of
the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?&quot;

&quot;These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,&quot;
and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an
air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.

&quot;It&#39;s a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks
young and happy again,&quot; and John kissed the smiling face, to the great
detriment of the rosebud under the chin.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new
concerts some night.  I really need some music to put me in tune.  Will
you, please?&quot;

&quot;Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You
have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall
enjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?&quot;

&quot;Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous
and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and
less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I&#39;m to see to
things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just
to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before
my time.  It&#39;s only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your
sake as much as for mine, because I&#39;ve neglected you shamefully lately,
and I&#39;m going to make home what it used to be, if I can.  You don&#39;t
object, I hope?&quot;

Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little
bonnet had from utter ruin.  All that we have any business to know is
that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which
gradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all
Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of
labor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for
accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while
Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of
wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential
conversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and
John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts
came to the Brookes&#39; now, and everyone found the little house a
cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love.  Even
Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.  &quot;It is always so quiet and pleasant
here, it does me good, Meg,&quot; she used to say, looking about her with
wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it
in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no
riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own,
where there was no place for her.

This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had
found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to
use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual
helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.
This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent
to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding
loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,
undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through
fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true
sense of the good old Saxon word, the &#39;house-band&#39;, and learning, as
Meg learned, that a woman&#39;s happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor
the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.



CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

LAZY LAURENCE

Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He
was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy&#39;s familiar presence seemed
to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a
part.  He rather missed the &#39;petting&#39; he used to receive, and enjoyed a
taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from
strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls
at home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very
glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the
representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she
would confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other&#39;s society and
were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice
no one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while
apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were
half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each
other.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in
hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to
please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he
gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly
women know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort
of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as
possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind
word because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be
generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she
would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not
change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the
keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,
half-scornful surprise.

&quot;All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at
home and write letters.  They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa
to sketch, will you come?&quot; said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely
day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.

&quot;Well, yes, but isn&#39;t it rather warm for such a long walk?&quot; he answered
slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.

&quot;I&#39;m going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so
you&#39;ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves
nice,&quot; returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,
which were a weak point with Laurie.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll go with pleasure.&quot; and he put out his hand for her
sketchbook.  But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...

&quot;Don&#39;t trouble yourself.  It&#39;s no exertion to me, but you don&#39;t look
equal to it.&quot;

Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran
downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins
himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and
fall asleep on his perch.

The two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie
was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an
inquiring air.  She answered him with a smile, and they went on
together in the most amicable manner.

It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque
scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.  Here an ancient monastery,
whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them.  There a
bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket
over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among
the rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with
panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a
capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with
a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the
quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on
the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky
foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones
fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the
Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.

Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer
roses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust
themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to
passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and
feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where
seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool
grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every
fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to
smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped
the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of
the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,
and the white-walled city on its shore.

&quot;This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn&#39;t it?  Did you ever see such
roses?&quot; asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a
luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.

&quot;No, nor felt such thorns,&quot; returned Laurie, with his thumb in his
mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that
grew just beyond his reach.

&quot;Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,&quot; said Amy,
gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall
behind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he
stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in
the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and
he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,
when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for
romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny
red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones
like that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him
were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal
wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for
himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better
of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard
since he came.

&quot;It&#39;s good advice, you&#39;d better take it and save your fingers,&quot; she
said, thinking her speech amused him.

&quot;Thank you, I will,&quot; he answered in jest, and a few months later he did
it in earnest.

&quot;Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?&quot; she asked presently,
as she settled herself on a rustic seat.

&quot;Very soon.&quot;

&quot;You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.&quot;

&quot;I dare say, short answers save trouble.&quot;

&quot;He expects you, and you really ought to go.&quot;

&quot;Hospitable creature!  I know it.&quot;

&quot;Then why don&#39;t you do it?&quot;

&quot;Natural depravity, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Natural indolence, you mean.  It&#39;s really dreadful!&quot; and Amy looked
severe.

&quot;Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I
might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it
better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,&quot; and Laurie
composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.

Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of
resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture &#39;that boy&#39; and in
a minute she began again.

&quot;What are you doing just now?&quot;

&quot;Watching lizards.&quot;

&quot;No, no.  I mean what do you intend and wish to do?&quot;

&quot;Smoke a cigarette, if you&#39;ll allow me.&quot;

&quot;How provoking you are!  I don&#39;t approve of cigars and I will only
allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.  I need a
figure.&quot;

&quot;With all the pleasure in life.  How will you have me, full length or
three-quarters, on my head or my heels?  I should respectfully suggest
a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it &#39;Dolce far
niente&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.  I intend to work hard,&quot;
said Amy in her most energetic tone.

&quot;What delightful enthusiasm!&quot; and he leaned against a tall urn with an
air of entire satisfaction.

&quot;What would Jo say if she saw you now?&quot; asked Amy impatiently, hoping
to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister&#39;s name.

&quot;As usual, &#39;Go away, Teddy.  I&#39;m busy!&#39;&quot; He laughed as he spoke, but
the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the
utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed
yet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them
before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on
Laurie&#39;s face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and
regret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless
expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic
pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in
the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for
he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.

&quot;You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,&quot; she
said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark
stone.

&quot;Wish I was!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so
changed, I sometimes think--&quot; there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,
half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.

Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated
to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used
to say it to her mother, &quot;It&#39;s all right, ma&#39;am.&quot;

That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry
her lately.  It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the
cordial tone in which she said...

&quot;I&#39;m glad of that!  I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d been a very bad boy, but I
fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost
your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into
some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of
a foreign tour.  Don&#39;t stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the
grass here and &#39;let us be friendly&#39;, as Jo used to say when we got in
the sofa corner and told secrets.&quot;

Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse
himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy&#39;s hat, that lay
there.

&quot;I&#39;m all ready for the secrets.&quot; and he glanced up with a decided
expression of interest in his eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ve none to tell.  You may begin.&quot;

&quot;Haven&#39;t one to bless myself with.  I thought perhaps you&#39;d had some
news from home..&quot;

&quot;You have heard all that has come lately.  Don&#39;t you hear often?  I
fancied Jo would send you volumes.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s very busy.  I&#39;m roving about so, it&#39;s impossible to be regular,
you know.  When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?&quot; he
asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he
had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.

&quot;Never,&quot; she answered, with a despondent but decided air. &quot;Rome took
all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt
too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.&quot;

&quot;Why should you, with so much energy and talent?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just why, because talent isn&#39;t genius, and no amount of energy
can make it so.  I want to be great, or nothing. I won&#39;t be a
common-place dauber, so I don&#39;t intend to try any more.&quot;

&quot;And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?&quot;

&quot;Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get
the chance.&quot;

It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity
becomes young people, and Amy&#39;s ambition had a good foundation.  Laurie
smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose
when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.

&quot;Good!  And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.&quot;

Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her
downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, &quot;Now I&#39;m going
to play brother, and ask questions.  May I?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t promise to answer.&quot;

&quot;Your face will, if your tongue won&#39;t.  You aren&#39;t woman of the world
enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.  I heard rumors about Fred
and you last year, and it&#39;s my private opinion that if he had not been
called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come
of it, hey?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not for me to say,&quot; was Amy&#39;s grim reply, but her lips would
smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed
that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.

&quot;You are not engaged, I hope?&quot; and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly
and grave all of a sudden.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees,
won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Very likely.&quot;

&quot;Then you are fond of old Fred?&quot;

&quot;I could be, if I tried.&quot;

&quot;But you don&#39;t intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul,
what unearthly prudence!  He&#39;s a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I
fancied you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,&quot; began Amy,
trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of
herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.

&quot;I understand.  Queens of society can&#39;t get on without money, so you
mean to make a good match, and start in that way?  Quite right and
proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of
your mother&#39;s girls.&quot;

&quot;True, nevertheless.&quot;

A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered
contrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this
instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of
disappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as
well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her
resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.

&quot;I wish you&#39;d do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,&quot; she said
sharply.

&quot;Do it for me, there&#39;s a dear girl.&quot;

&quot;I could, if I tried.&quot; and she looked as if she would like doing it in
the most summary style.

&quot;Try, then.  I give you leave,&quot; returned Laurie, who enjoyed having
someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.

&quot;You&#39;d be angry in five minutes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m never angry with you.  It takes two flints to make a fire. You are
as cool and soft as snow.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if
applied rightly.  Your indifference is half affectation, and a good
stirring up would prove it.&quot;

&quot;Stir away, it won&#39;t hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said
when his little wife beat him.  Regard me in the light of a husband or
a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees
with you.&quot;

Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the
apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and
began.

&quot;Flo and I have got a new name for you.  It&#39;s Lazy Laurence. How do you
like it?&quot;

She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his
head, with an imperturbable, &quot;That&#39;s not bad. Thank you, ladies.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?&quot;

&quot;Pining to be told.&quot;

&quot;Well, I despise you.&quot;

If she had even said &#39;I hate you&#39; in a petulant or coquettish tone, he
would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,
accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...

&quot;Why, if you please?&quot;

&quot;Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are
faulty, lazy, and miserable.&quot;

&quot;Strong language, mademoiselle.&quot;

&quot;If you like it, I&#39;ll go on.&quot;

&quot;Pray do, it&#39;s quite interesting.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d find it so.  Selfish people always like to talk about
themselves.&quot;

&quot;Am I selfish?&quot; the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of
surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.

&quot;Yes, very selfish,&quot; continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as
effective just then as an angry one.  &quot;I&#39;ll show you how, for I&#39;ve
studied you while we were frolicking, and I&#39;m not at all satisfied with
you.  Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but
waste time and money and disappoint your friends.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t look as if you&#39;d had much.  At any rate, you are none the
better for it, as far as I can see.  I said when we first met that you
had improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don&#39;t think you half so
nice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you
like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to
be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and
respected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and
beauty, ah you like that old Vanity!  But it&#39;s the truth, so I can&#39;t
help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you
can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you
ought to be, you are only...&quot;  there she stopped, with a look that had
both pain and pity in it.

&quot;Saint Laurence on a gridiron,&quot; added Laurie, blandly finishing the
sentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a
wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured
expression replaced the former indifference.

&quot;I supposed you&#39;d take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say
we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you
good, you laugh at us and won&#39;t listen, which proves how much your
flattery is worth.&quot; Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the
exasperating martyr at her feet.

In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,
and Laurie&#39;s voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, &quot;I
will be good, oh, I will be good!&quot;

But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the
outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, &quot;Aren&#39;t you ashamed of a
hand like that?  It&#39;s as soft and white as a woman&#39;s, and looks as if
it never did anything but wear Jouvin&#39;s best gloves and pick flowers
for ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I&#39;m glad to see
there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one
Jo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!&quot;

&quot;So do I!&quot;

The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough
in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with
a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his
face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw
his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a
sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as
if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in
a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in
Amy&#39;s mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.
She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled
the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the
wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome
hand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.
Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the
alteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when
she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and
kind when she chose to make it so.

&quot;I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren&#39;t
the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you&#39;d be very angry with me.
But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn&#39;t bear to think they
should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps
they would understand the change better than I do.&quot;

&quot;I think they would,&quot; came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as
touching as a broken one.

&quot;They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,
when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did
like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!&quot; said artful Amy, wishing to
be sure of her facts this time.

&quot;Hang Miss Randal!&quot; and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look
that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.

&quot;I beg pardon, I thought...&quot; and there she paused diplomatically.

&quot;No, you didn&#39;t, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but
Jo,&quot; Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face
away as he spoke.

&quot;I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came
away, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn&#39;t be kind to you?  Why,
I was sure she loved you dearly.&quot;

&quot;She was kind, but not in the right way, and it&#39;s lucky for her she
didn&#39;t love me, if I&#39;m the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It&#39;s
her fault though, and you may tell her so.&quot;

The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled
Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.

&quot;I was wrong, I didn&#39;t know.  I&#39;m very sorry I was so cross, but I
can&#39;t help wishing you&#39;d bear it better, Teddy, dear.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t, that&#39;s her name for me!&quot; and Laurie put up his hand with a
quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo&#39;s half-kind,
half-reproachful tone.  &quot;Wait till you&#39;ve tried it yourself,&quot; he added
in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.

&quot;I&#39;d take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn&#39;t be loved,&quot; said
Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.

Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,
making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live
it down alone.  Amy&#39;s lecture put the matter in a new light, and for
the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first
failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if
suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to
sleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, &quot;Do you think Jo
would despise me as you do?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don&#39;t you do
something splendid, and make her love you?&quot;

&quot;I did my best, but it was no use.&quot;

&quot;Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have
done, for your grandfather&#39;s sake.  It would have been shameful to fail
after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you
could do well.&quot;

&quot;I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn&#39;t love me,&quot; began Laurie,
leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.

&quot;No, you didn&#39;t, and you&#39;ll say so in the end, for it did you good, and
proved that you could do something if you tried. If you&#39;d only set
about another task of some sort, you&#39;d soon be your hearty, happy self
again, and forget your trouble.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s impossible.&quot;

&quot;Try it and see.  You needn&#39;t shrug your shoulders, and think, &#39;Much
she knows about such things&#39;.  I don&#39;t pretend to be wise, but I am
observing, and I see a great deal more than you&#39;d imagine.  I&#39;m
interested in other people&#39;s experiences and inconsistencies, and
though I can&#39;t explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.
Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don&#39;t let it spoil you, for
it&#39;s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can&#39;t have the
one you want.  There, I won&#39;t lecture any more, for I know you&#39;ll wake
up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.&quot;

Neither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring
on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had
been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,
merely saying, &quot;How do you like that?&quot;

He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it
was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless
face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the
little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer&#39;s head.

&quot;How well you draw!&quot; he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at
her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;As you are.  This is as you were.&quot; and Amy laid another sketch beside
the one he held.

It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it
which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that
a sudden change swept over the young man&#39;s face as he looked.  Only a
rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and
every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude
was full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,
stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot
impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for
the voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider&#39;s
breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly
arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that
contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the &#39;_Dolce far Niente_&#39;
sketch.  Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other,
Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and
accepted the little lesson she had given him.  That satisfied her, and
without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all
looked on?  Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,
and I sat on the fence and drew you.  I found that sketch in my
portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.&quot;

&quot;Much obliged.  You&#39;ve improved immensely since then, and I
congratulate you.  May I venture to suggest in &#39;a honeymoon paradise&#39;
that five o&#39;clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?&quot;

Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow
and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures
should have an end.  He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent
air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more
effacious than he would confess.  Amy felt the shade of coldness in his
manner, and said to herself...

&quot;Now, I&#39;ve offended him.  Well, if it does him good, I&#39;m glad, if it
makes him hate me, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s true, and I can&#39;t take back a
word of it.&quot;

They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up
behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming
spirits.  But both felt ill at ease.  The friendly frankness was
disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their
apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.

&quot;Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?&quot; asked Amy, as they parted
at her aunt&#39;s door.

&quot;Unfortunately I have an engagement.  Au revoir, madamoiselle,&quot; and
Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which
became him better than many men.  Something in his face made Amy say
quickly and warmly...

&quot;No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I&#39;d
rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental
salutations in France.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye, dear,&quot; and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,
Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.

Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made
her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.

My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within
yourself, for &#39;Lazy Laurence&#39; has gone to his grandpa, like the best of
boys.  A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful
honeymoon at Valrosa!  I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser.
Tell him so, with my congratulations.

Yours gratefully, Telemachus


&quot;Good boy!  I&#39;m glad he&#39;s gone,&quot; said Amy, with an approving smile. The
next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,
with an involuntary sigh, &quot;Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him.&quot;



CHAPTER FORTY

THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW

When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,
and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased
affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of
trouble.  They put away their grief, and each did his or her part
toward making that last year a happy one.

The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was
gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano,
the little worktable, and the beloved pussies.  Father&#39;s best books
found their way there, Mother&#39;s easy chair, Jo&#39;s desk, Amy&#39;s finest
sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,
to make sunshine for Aunty Beth.  John quietly set apart a little sum,
that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with
the fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of
concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears
as she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful
letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands
that know no winter.

Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,
tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,
unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to
make it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers
were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for
the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens
from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small
mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through
forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner
of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of
learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to
regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above
there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and
needs.  If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright
little faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and
the droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.

The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look
round, and say &quot;How beautiful this is!&quot; as they all sat together in her
sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and
sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from
the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as
applicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a
paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn,
trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make
resignation possible.  Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls
of those who listened, for the father&#39;s heart was in the minister&#39;s
religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence
to the words he spoke or read.

It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as
preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the
needle was &#39;so heavy&#39;, and put it down forever.  Talking wearied her,
faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil
spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble
flesh.  Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching
hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced
to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the
bitter cry, &quot;Help me, help me!&quot; and to feel that there was no help.  A
sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with
death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion
over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever.  With the wreck
of her frail body, Beth&#39;s soul grew strong, and though she said little,
those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim
called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,
trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed
the river.

Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said &quot;I feel stronger when
you are here.&quot;  She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew
the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom
asked for anything, and &#39;tried not to be a trouble&#39;.  All day she
haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being
chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.  Precious and
helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it
needed.  Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could
not fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can
forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the
hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts
undoubtingly.

Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,
heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her
lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the
transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too
deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was
trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the
life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music
she loved so well.

Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest
hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter.  For with
eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest
sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister&#39;s life--uneventful,
unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which &#39;smell sweet, and
blossom in the dust&#39;, the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on
earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible
to all.

One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find
something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as
hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,
Pilgrims&#39;s Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo&#39;s
hand.  The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made
her sure that tears had fallen on it.

&quot;Poor Jo!  She&#39;s fast asleep, so I won&#39;t wake her to ask leave.  She
shows me all her things, and I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll mind if I look at
this&quot;, thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug,
with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell
apart.

    MY BETH

    Sitting patient in the shadow
    Till the blessed light shall come,
    A serene and saintly presence
    Sanctifies our troubled home.
    Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows
    Break like ripples on the strand
    Of the deep and solemn river
    Where her willing feet now stand.

    O my sister, passing from me,
    Out of human care and strife,
    Leave me, as a gift, those virtues
    Which have beautified your life.
    Dear, bequeath me that great patience
    Which has power to sustain
    A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit
    In its prison-house of pain.

    Give me, for I need it sorely,
    Of that courage, wise and sweet,
    Which has made the path of duty
    Green beneath your willing feet.
    Give me that unselfish nature,
    That with charity divine
    Can pardon wrong for love&#39;s dear sake--
    Meek heart, forgive me mine!

    Thus our parting daily loseth
    Something of its bitter pain,
    And while learning this hard lesson,
    My great loss becomes my gain.
    For the touch of grief will render
    My wild nature more serene,
    Give to life new aspirations,
    A new trust in the unseen.

    Henceforth, safe across the river,
    I shall see forever more
    A beloved, household spirit
    Waiting for me on the shore.
    Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,
    Guardian angels shall become,
    And the sister gone before me
    By their hands shall lead me home.

Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought
a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth&#39;s face, for her one regret had
been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that
her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the
despair she feared.  As she sat with the paper folded between her
hands, the charred log fell asunder.  Jo started up, revived the blaze,
and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.

&quot;Not asleep, but so happy, dear.  See, I found this and read it. I knew
you wouldn&#39;t care.  Have I been all that to you, Jo?&quot; she asked, with
wistful, humble earnestness.

&quot;_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much!&quot; and Jo&#39;s head went down upon the pillow
beside her sister&#39;s.

&quot;Then I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;d wasted my life.  I&#39;m not so good as you
make me, but I have tried to do right.  And now, when it&#39;s too late to
begin even to do better, it&#39;s such a comfort to know that someone loves
me so much, and feels as if I&#39;d helped them.&quot;

&quot;More than any one in the world, Beth.  I used to think I couldn&#39;t let
you go, but I&#39;m learning to feel that I don&#39;t lose you, that you&#39;ll be
more to me than ever, and death can&#39;t part us, though it seems to.&quot;

&quot;I know it cannot, and I don&#39;t fear it any longer, for I&#39;m sure I shall
be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever.  You must take
my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I&#39;m gone.
They will turn to you, don&#39;t fail them, and if it&#39;s hard to work alone,
remember that I don&#39;t forget you, and that you&#39;ll be happier in doing
that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is
the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the
end so easy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try, Beth.&quot; and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,
pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of
other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the
immortality of love.

So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth
greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in
time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,
clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother
guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up
to God.

Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions,
or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many
parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply
as sleep.  As Beth had hoped, the &#39;tide went out easily&#39;, and in the
dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first
breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving
look, one little sigh.

With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her
ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with
grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic
patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent
joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom
full of dread.

When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,
Jo&#39;s place was empty, and the room was very still.  But a bird sang
blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly
at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction
over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace
that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked
God that Beth was well at last.



CHAPTER FORTY-ONE

LEARNING TO FORGET

Amy&#39;s lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it
till long afterward.  Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers,
the lords of creation don&#39;t take the advice till they have persuaded
themselves that it is just what they intended to do.  Then they act
upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the
credit of it.  If it fails, they generously give her the whole.  Laurie
went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several
weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved
him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the
young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have
dragged him back after the scolding he had received.  Pride forbid, and
whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by
repeating the words that had made the deepest impression--&quot;I despise
you.&quot; &quot;Go and do something splendid that will make her love you.&quot;

Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought
himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but then when a
man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries
till he has lived it down.  He felt that his blighted affections were
quite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful
mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.  Jo
wouldn&#39;t love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by
doing something which should prove that a girl&#39;s &#39;No&#39; had not spoiled
his life.  He had always meant to do something, and Amy&#39;s advice was
quite unnecessary.  He had only been waiting till the aforesaid
blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt
that he was ready to &#39;hide his stricken heart, and still toil on&#39;.

As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie
resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem
which should harrow up Jo&#39;s soul and melt the heart of every hearer.
Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless
and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical
friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish
himself.  But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music,
or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that
the Requiem was beyond him just at present.  It was evident that his
mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for
often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself
humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at
Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to
tragic composition for the time being.

Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning,
but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him.  He wanted Jo for his
heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender
recollections and romantic visions of his love.  But memory turned
traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would
only recall Jo&#39;s oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in
the most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in a
bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold
water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable laugh spoiled
the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint.  Jo wouldn&#39;t be put
into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a &quot;Bless
that girl, what a torment she is!&quot; and a clutch at his hair, as became
a distracted composer.

When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to
immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging
readiness.  This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden
hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before
his mind&#39;s eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies,
and blue ribbons.  He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but
he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he
might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and
escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated
any mortal woman.

Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but
gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he
sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new
ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled
state that winter.  He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and
was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.
&quot;It&#39;s genius simmering, perhaps.  I&#39;ll let it simmer, and see what
comes of it,&quot; he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it
wasn&#39;t genius, but something far more common.  Whatever it was, it
simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with
his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go
at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that
everyone who loved music was not a composer.  Returning from one of
Mozart&#39;s grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he
looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the
busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back
again.  Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as
the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...

&quot;She is right!  Talent isn&#39;t genius, and you can&#39;t make it so.  That
music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I
won&#39;t be a humbug any longer.  Now what shall I do?&quot;

That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had
to work for his daily bread.  Now if ever, occurred an eligible
opportunity for &#39;going to the devil&#39;, as he once forcibly expressed it,
for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially
fond of providing employment for full and idle hands.  The poor fellow
had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood
them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith
and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire
to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,
and say &quot;All&#39;s well,&quot; kept him safe and steady.

Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it, boys
will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not
expect miracles.&quot;  I dare say you don&#39;t, Mrs. Grundy, but it&#39;s true
nevertheless.  Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion
that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by
refusing to echo such sayings.  Let the boys be boys, the longer the
better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must.  But
mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one,
and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and
showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues
which make men manliest in good women&#39;s eyes.  If it is a feminine
delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the
beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would
embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who
still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to
own it.

Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb
all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it
grew easier every day.  He refused to believe it at first, got angry
with himself, and couldn&#39;t understand it, but these hearts of ours are
curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in
spite of us.  Laurie&#39;s heart wouldn&#39;t ache.  The wound persisted in
healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to
forget, he found himself trying to remember.  He had not foreseen this
turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it.  He was disgusted with
himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture
of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a
tremendous blow so soon.  He carefully stirred up the embers of his
lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze.  There was only a
comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into
a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish
passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very
tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass
away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken
to the end.

As the word &#39;brotherly&#39; passed through his mind in one of his reveries,
he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before
him...

&quot;Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn&#39;t have one sister he took
the other, and was happy.&quot;

Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next
instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, &quot;No, I won&#39;t!  I
haven&#39;t forgotten, I never can.  I&#39;ll try again, and if that fails, why
then...&quot;

Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to
Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was
the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn&#39;t she, wouldn&#39;t
she--and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he
did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of
impatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one
point, for Jo decidedly couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t.  She was wrapped up in
Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged
him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of
his heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him
not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring
and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That
would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often,
and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.

&quot;So I will, at once.  Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for
her, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had
been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks
before.

But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his
best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.
Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and
business documents of various kinds were several of Jo&#39;s letters, and
in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up
with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead
roses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,
Laurie gathered up all Jo&#39;s letters, smoothed, folded, and put them
neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring
thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the
letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint
Stefan&#39;s, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not
overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the
rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.

The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy
was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding
manner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to
and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie
sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,
hoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go
to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,
for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made
her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of &#39;our boy&#39;.

Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once
decided to answer, &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; but now she said, &quot;No, thank you,&quot;
kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,
and she found that something more than money and position was needed to
satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes
and fears.  The words, &quot;Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I
fancied you would ever like,&quot; and Laurie&#39;s face when he uttered them,
kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in
look, if not in words, &quot;I shall marry for money.&quot;  It troubled her to
remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so
unwomanly. She didn&#39;t want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly
creature.  She didn&#39;t care to be a queen of society now half so much as
she did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn&#39;t hate her for
the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was
kinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home
letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when
they did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,
for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted
in being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to
love him.  It couldn&#39;t be very hard, many people would be proud and
glad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act
like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat
him like a brother.

If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they
would be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never
lectured now.  She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was
interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,
and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly
confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.
As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about
in their sister&#39;s pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when
short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that
Amy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did
grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for
society, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much
to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while
she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or
absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight
carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over
his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a
ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur
according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether
satisfactory.

Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding
denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what
she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to
Egypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he
said to himself, with a venerable air...

&quot;I was sure she would think better of it.  Poor old fellow! I&#39;ve been
through it all, and I can sympathize.&quot;

With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his
duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy&#39;s letter
luxuriously.

While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.
But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and
when the next found her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from
Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of
Genoa and the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly
submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit,
for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay,
and let absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she
longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake,
waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.

He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,
but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.  The moment
he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow
pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy
and sorrow, hope and suspense.

He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he
hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en
pension.  The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to
take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be
in the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of
sitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could
not wait even a &#39;flash of time&#39;, and in the middle of the speech
departed to find mademoiselle himself.

A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts
rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the
tower falling far across the sunny water.  At one corner of the wide,
low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or
console herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here
that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy
eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did
not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the
archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood
a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen
before, the tender side of Amy&#39;s character. Everything about her mutely
suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black
ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her
face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to
Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only
ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,
they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for
dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of
unmistakable love and longing...

&quot;Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you&#39;d come to me!&quot;

I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood
together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down
protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and
sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only
woman in the world who could fill Jo&#39;s place and make him happy.  He
did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the
truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.

In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,
Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry
well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.
As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at
the recollection of her impulsive greeting.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to
see you.  It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was
beginning to fear you wouldn&#39;t come,&quot; she said, trying in vain to speak
quite naturally.

&quot;I came the minute I heard.  I wish I could say something to comfort
you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...&quot;  He
could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,
and did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy&#39;s head down
on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,
so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was
better than words.

&quot;You needn&#39;t say anything, this comforts me,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Beth
is well and happy, and I mustn&#39;t wish her back, but I dread the going
home, much as I long to see them all. We won&#39;t talk about it now, for
it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay.  You needn&#39;t
go right back, need you?&quot;

&quot;Not if you want me, dear.&quot;

&quot;I do, so much.  Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of
the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little
while.&quot;

Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that
Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she
wanted--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she
needed.

&quot;Poor little soul, you look as if you&#39;d grieved yourself half sick!
I&#39;m going to take care of you, so don&#39;t cry any more, but come and walk
about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,&quot; he said,
in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied
on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the
sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon
his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,
a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully
for her alone.

The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed
expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but
the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of
their words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked
and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which
gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell
warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and
sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.

The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl&#39;s altered face, she was illuminated
with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, &quot;Now I understand it
all--the child has been pining for young Laurence.  Bless my heart, I
never thought of such a thing!&quot;

With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed
no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged
Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much
solitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal
occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it
with more than her usual success.

At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was
never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the
most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed
his example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was
owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a
like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.

The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked
wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get
clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.
The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and
moody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of
aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to
wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look
benignly down upon them saying, &quot;Little children, love one another.&quot;

In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that
Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.  It took him a little
while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he
had firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for
the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo&#39;s sister was almost the
same as Jo&#39;s self, and the conviction that it would have been
impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His
first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon
it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion
blended with regret.  He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one
of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be
grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should
be as calm and simple as possible.  There was no need of having a
scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it
without words and had given him his answer long ago.  It all came about
so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody
would be pleased, even Jo.  But when our first little passion has been
crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so
Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance
the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and
sweetest part of his new romance.

He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the
chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous
manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was
settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been
floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.  Gingolf to sunny
Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St.  Bernard and the
Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne
upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake
below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged
gulls.

They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of
Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise.
Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each
privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own.  Amy had
been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell
between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars
with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for
the sake of saying something...

&quot;You must be tired.  Rest a little, and let me row.  It will do me
good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.  There&#39;s room
enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won&#39;t
trim,&quot; returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.

Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered
third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar.
She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used
both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went
smoothly through the water.

&quot;How well we pull together, don&#39;t we?&quot; said Amy, who objected to
silence just then.

&quot;So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,
Amy?&quot; very tenderly.

&quot;Yes, Laurie,&quot; very low.

Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little
tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected
in the lake.



CHAPTER FORTY-TWO

ALL ALONE

It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in
another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.  But when
the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved
presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo
found her promise very hard to keep.  How could she &#39;comfort Father and
Mother&#39; when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her
sister, how could she &#39;make the house cheerful&#39; when all its light and
warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old
home for the new, and where in all the world could she &#39;find some
useful, happy work to do&#39;, that would take the place of the loving
service which had been its own reward?  She tried in a blind, hopeless
way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it
seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made
heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.  Some
people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.  It was not
fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,
only disappointment, trouble and hard work.

Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came
over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,
devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that
never seemed to grow any easier.  &quot;I can&#39;t do it. I wasn&#39;t meant for a
life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something
desperate if somebody doesn&#39;t come and help me,&quot; she said to herself,
when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable
state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the
inevitable.

But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good
angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple
spells best fitted to poor humanity.  Often she started up at night,
thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed
made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, &quot;Oh, Beth,
come back!  Come back!&quot; she did not stretch out her yearning arms in
vain.  For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her
sister&#39;s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with
words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo&#39;s, and broken
whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went
hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to
heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,
which chastened grief and strengthened love.  Feeling this, Jo&#39;s burden
seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more
endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother&#39;s arms.

When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found
help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray
head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly,
&quot;Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.  I need it more than she did,
for I&#39;m all wrong.&quot;

&quot;My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,&quot; he answered, with a falter
in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and
did not fear to ask for it.

Then, sitting in Beth&#39;s little chair close beside him, Jo told her
troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that
discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all
the sad bewilderment which we call despair.  She gave him entire
confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation
in the act.  For the time had come when they could talk together not
only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to
serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love.  Happy,
thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called &#39;the church of
one member&#39;, and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered
cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had
taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach
another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its
beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.

Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would
not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned
to see and value.  Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful
as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something
of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and
the old brush, never thrown away.  As she used them, Jo found herself
humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth&#39;s orderly ways, and
giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and
cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she
didn&#39;t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...

&quot;You thoughtful creeter, you&#39;re determined we shan&#39;t miss that dear
lamb ef you can help it.  We don&#39;t say much, but we see it, and the
Lord will bless you for&#39;t, see ef He don&#39;t.&quot;

As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister
Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly
impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and
children, and how much they were all doing for each other.

&quot;Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.  I wonder if I should
blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?, always
_&#39;perwisin&#39;_ I could,&quot; said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in
the topsy-turvy nursery.

&quot;It&#39;s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your
nature, Jo.  You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but
silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.  Love
will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will
fall off.&quot;

&quot;Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma&#39;am, and it takes a good shake to bring
them down.  Boys go nutting, and I don&#39;t care to be bagged by them,&quot;
returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would
ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.

Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo&#39;s old spirit, but
she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her
power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
Meg&#39;s most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.
Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo&#39;s was nearly ready for
the bag.  A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy&#39;s
impatient shake, but a man&#39;s hand reached up to pick it gently from the
burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she
would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately
she wasn&#39;t thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she
dropped.

Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at
this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the
world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in
her pocket.  But, you see, Jo wasn&#39;t a heroine, she was only a
struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out
her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood
suggested.  It&#39;s highly virtuous to say we&#39;ll be good, but we can&#39;t do
it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.  Jo
had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if
she did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!  She
had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,
and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to
devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to
them as they had to her?  And if difficulties were necessary to
increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a
restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and
desires, and cheerfully live for others?

Providence had taken her at her word.  Here was the task, not what she
had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she
do it?  She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she
found the helps I have suggested.  Still another was given her, and she
took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the
refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed
the hill called Difficulty.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you write?  That always used to make you happy,&quot; said her
mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.

&quot;I&#39;ve no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.&quot;

&quot;We do.  Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.
Try it, dear.  I&#39;m sure it would do you good, and please us very much.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t believe I can.&quot;  But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul
her half-finished manuscripts.

An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching
away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which
caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success
of her suggestion.  Jo never knew how it happened, but something got
into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,
for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it,
much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her
utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.
Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the
appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as
well as friends admired it.  For a small thing it was a great success,
and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and
condemned all at once.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand it.  What can there be in a simple little story
like that to make people praise it so?&quot; she said, quite bewildered.

&quot;There is truth in it, Jo, that&#39;s the secret.  Humor and pathos make it
alive, and you have found your style at last.  You wrote with no
thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter.
You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.  Do your best, and grow
as happy as we are in your success.&quot;

&quot;If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn&#39;t mine.  I
owe it all to you and Mother and Beth,&quot; said Jo, more touched by her
father&#39;s words than by any amount of praise from the world.

So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent
them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very
charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly
welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like
dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.

When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that
Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon
set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very
quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for &#39;the children&#39; before she
read the letter twice.  It was a sort of written duet, wherein each
glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and
satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.

&quot;You like it, Mother?&quot; said Jo, as they laid down the closely written
sheets and looked at one another.

&quot;Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused
Fred.  I felt sure then that something better than what you call the
&#39;mercenary spirit&#39; had come over her, and a hint here and there in her
letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.&quot;

&quot;How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent!  You never said a word to
me.&quot;

&quot;Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have
girls to manage.  I was half afraid to put the idea into your head,
lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was
settled.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the scatterbrain I was.  You may trust me.  I&#39;m sober and
sensible enough for anyone&#39;s confidante now.&quot;

&quot;So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied
it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else.&quot;

&quot;Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,
after I&#39;d refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?&quot;

&quot;I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he
came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another
answer.  Forgive me, dear, I can&#39;t help seeing that you are very
lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to
my heart.  So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he
tried now.&quot;

&quot;No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I&#39;m glad Amy has learned to
love him.  But you are right in one thing.  I am lonely, and perhaps if
Teddy had tried again, I might have said &#39;Yes&#39;, not because I love him
any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are
plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother,
sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all
comes to give you your reward.&quot;

&quot;Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don&#39;t mind whispering
to Marmee that I&#39;d like to try all kinds.  It&#39;s very curious, but the
more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the
more I seem to want.  I&#39;d no idea hearts could take in so many.  Mine
is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite
contented with my family.  I don&#39;t understand it.&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the
leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.

&quot;It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me.  He isn&#39;t
sentimental, doesn&#39;t say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he
says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don&#39;t seem
to be the same girl I was.  I never knew how good and generous and
tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it
full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know
it&#39;s mine.  He says he feels as if he &#39;could make a prosperous voyage
now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast&#39;.  I pray he
may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain
with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while
God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven
this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy!  Truly, love does work
miracles.  How very, very happy they must be!&quot; and Jo laid the rustling
sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a
lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he
finds himself alone in the workaday world again.

By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not
walk.  A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,
not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one
sister should have all she asked, the other nothing.  It was not true,
she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for
affection was strong, and Amy&#39;s happiness woke the hungry longing for
someone to &#39;love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them
be together&#39;. Up in the garret, where Jo&#39;s unquiet wanderings ended
stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners
name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended
now for all.  Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own,
leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic
collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye.  She
drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at
kind Mrs. Kirke&#39;s.  She had smiled at first, then she looked
thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in
the Professor&#39;s hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of
her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new
meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.

&quot;Wait for me, my friend.  I may be a little late, but I shall surely
come.&quot;

&quot;Oh, if he only would!  So kind, so good, so patient with me always, my
dear old Fritz.  I didn&#39;t value him half enough when I had him, but now
how I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away from me,
and I&#39;m all alone.&quot;

And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be
fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried,
as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.

Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits?  Or was it the waking
up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its
inspirer?  Who shall say?



CHAPTER FORTY-THREE

SURPRISES

Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the
fire, and thinking.  It was her favorite way of spending the hour of
dusk.  No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth&#39;s little
red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender
thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.  Her face looked
tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she
was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and
how little she seemed to have accomplished.  Almost twenty-five, and
nothing to show for it.  Jo was mistaken in that.  There was a good
deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.

&quot;An old maid, that&#39;s what I&#39;m to be.  A literary spinster, with a pen
for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence
a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I&#39;m old and can&#39;t
enjoy it, solitary, and can&#39;t share it, independent, and don&#39;t need it.
Well, I needn&#39;t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,
old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but...&quot; and
there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.

It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to
five-and-twenty.  But it&#39;s not as bad as it looks, and one can get on
quite happily if one has something in one&#39;s self to fall back upon.  At
twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly
resolve that they never will be.  At thirty they say nothing about it,
but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by
remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which
they may be learning to grow old gracefully.  Don&#39;t laugh at the
spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are
hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,
and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,
make the faded faces beautiful in God&#39;s sight.  Even the sad, sour
sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the
sweetest part of life, if for no other reason.  And looking at them
with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember
that they too may miss the blossom time.  That rosy cheeks don&#39;t last
forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and
that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and
admiration now.

Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter
how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that
which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,
and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color.  Just recollect
the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and
petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out
of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches
the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old
feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little
attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.  The
bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all
the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part
mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a
tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who
has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for &#39;the best nevvy
in the world&#39;.

Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this
little homily), for suddenly Laurie&#39;s ghost seemed to stand before her,
a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he
used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn&#39;t like to show it.  But,
like Jenny in the ballad...

  &quot;She could not think it he,&quot;

and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and
kissed her.  Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...

&quot;Oh my Teddy!  Oh my Teddy!&quot;

&quot;Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?&quot;

&quot;Glad!  My blessed boy, words can&#39;t express my gladness. Where&#39;s Amy?&quot;

&quot;Your mother has got her down at Meg&#39;s.  We stopped there by the way,
and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.&quot;

&quot;Your what?&quot; cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an
unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.

&quot;Oh, the dickens!  Now I&#39;ve done it,&quot; and he looked so guilty that Jo
was down on him like a flash.

&quot;You&#39;ve gone and got married!&quot;

&quot;Yes, please, but I never will again,&quot; and he went down upon his knees,
with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,
and triumph.

&quot;Actually married?&quot;

&quot;Very much so, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Mercy on us.  What dreadful thing will you do next?&quot; and Jo fell into
her seat with a gasp.

&quot;A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,&quot;
returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with
satisfaction.

&quot;What can you expect, when you take one&#39;s breath away, creeping in like
a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you
ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.&quot;

&quot;Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to
barricade.&quot;

Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted
the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, &quot;The old pillow is
up garret, and we don&#39;t need it now.  So, come and &#39;fess, Teddy.&quot;

&quot;How good it sounds to hear you say &#39;Teddy&#39;! No one ever calls me that
but you,&quot; and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.

&quot;What does Amy call you?&quot;

&quot;My lord.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s like her.  Well, you look it,&quot; and Jo&#39;s eye plainly betrayed
that she found her boy comelier than ever.

The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural
one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart.  Both felt it, and
for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a
little shadow over them.  It was gone directly however, for Laurie
said, with a vain attempt at dignity...

&quot;Don&#39;t I look like a married man and the head of a family?&quot;

&quot;Not a bit, and you never will.  You&#39;ve grown bigger and bonnier, but
you are the same scapegrace as ever.&quot;

&quot;Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,&quot; began
Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.

&quot;How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so
irresistibly funny that I can&#39;t keep sober!&quot; answered Jo, smiling all
over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then
settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.

&quot;It&#39;s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all
coming up presently.  I couldn&#39;t wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell
you the grand surprise, and have &#39;first skim&#39; as we used to say when we
squabbled about the cream.&quot;

&quot;Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong
end.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I&#39;m pining to
know.&quot;

&quot;Well, I did it to please Amy,&quot; began Laurie, with a twinkle that made
Jo exclaim...

&quot;Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,
if you can, sir.&quot;

&quot;Now she&#39;s beginning to marm it.  Isn&#39;t it jolly to hear her?&quot; said
Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite
agreed.  &quot;It&#39;s all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned
to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly
changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But
Grandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn&#39;t let
him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got
English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn&#39;t let Amy
come with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, &#39;Let&#39;s be
married, and then we can do as we like&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you.&quot;

&quot;Not always,&quot; and something in Laurie&#39;s voice made Jo say hastily...

&quot;How did you ever get Aunt to agree?&quot;

&quot;It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps
of good reasons on our side.  There wasn&#39;t time to write and ask leave,
but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only
&#39;taking time by the fetlock&#39;, as my wife says.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t we proud of those two words, and don&#39;t we like to say them?&quot;
interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with
delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been
so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.

&quot;A trifle, perhaps, she&#39;s such a captivating little woman I can&#39;t help
being proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play
propriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use
apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all
round, so we did it.&quot;

&quot;When, where, how?&quot; asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and
curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.

&quot;Six weeks ago, at the American consul&#39;s, in Paris, a very quiet
wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn&#39;t forget dear
little Beth.&quot;

Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the
little red pillow, which he remembered well.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you let us know afterward?&quot; asked Jo, in a quieter tone,
when they had sat quite still a minute.

&quot;We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,
at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found
he couldn&#39;t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend
our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular
honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but
once in their lives. My faith!  Wasn&#39;t it love among the roses!&quot;

Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the
fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured
her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away
her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the
half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly
gravity she had never seen in him before...

&quot;Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we&#39;ll put it by forever.
As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to
me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have
learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places
in my heart, that&#39;s all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have
come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I
never could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,
headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my
mistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after
making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,
at one time, that I didn&#39;t know which I loved best, you or Amy, and
tried to love you both alike.  But I couldn&#39;t, and when I saw her in
Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got
into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the
old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my
heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you
believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one
another?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy
and girl again.  The happy old times can&#39;t come back, and we mustn&#39;t
expect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for
playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I&#39;m sure you feel
this.  I see the change in you, and you&#39;ll find it in me.  I shall miss
my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because
he means to be what I hoped he would.  We can&#39;t be little playmates any
longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another
all our lives, won&#39;t we, Laurie?&quot;

He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his
face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish
passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them
both.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn&#39;t want the coming
home to be a sad one, &quot;I can&#39;t make it true that you children are
really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only
yesterday that I was buttoning Amy&#39;s pinafore, and pulling your hair
when you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!&quot;

&quot;As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn&#39;t talk so
like a grandma.  I flatter myself I&#39;m a &#39;gentleman growed&#39; as Peggotty
said of David, and when you see Amy, you&#39;ll find her rather a
precocious infant,&quot; said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.

&quot;You may be a little older in years, but I&#39;m ever so much older in
feeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a
hard one that I feel forty.&quot;

&quot;Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You
are older.  Here&#39;s a line, and there&#39;s another.  Unless you smile, your
eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear
on it.  You&#39;ve had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.
What a selfish beast I&#39;ve been!&quot; and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a
remorseful look.

But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone
which she tried to make more cheerful, &quot;No, I had Father and Mother to
help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you
and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.
I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it&#39;s good for me, and...&quot;

&quot;You never shall be again,&quot; broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,
as if to fence out every human ill.  &quot;Amy and I can&#39;t get on without
you, so you must come and teach &#39;the children&#39; to keep house, and go
halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and
all be blissfully happy and friendly together.&quot;

&quot;If I shouldn&#39;t be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to
feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly
away when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,&quot; and Jo leaned
her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill
and Laurie told her to hold on to him.

He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was
smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his
coming.

&quot;You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and
laughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.&quot;

&quot;Like angels!&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course, but which rules?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think
so, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for
marriage, they say, halves one&#39;s rights and doubles one&#39;s duties.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your
life.&quot;

&quot;Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don&#39;t think I shall mind
much.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I
rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and
prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you
a favor all the while.&quot;

&quot;That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying
it!&quot; cried Jo, with uplifted hands.

It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with
masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his &quot;high and
mighty&quot; air, &quot;Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of
man to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another
too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.&quot;

Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy
seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her
pleasure.

&quot;I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She
is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man
best, you remember.&quot;

&quot;She can blow him up as well as shine on him,&quot; laughed Laurie. &quot;Such a
lecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than
any of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I&#39;ll tell you all about it
sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised
and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and
married the good-for-nothing.&quot;

&quot;What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I&#39;ll defend
you.&quot;

&quot;I look as if I needed it, don&#39;t I?&quot; said Laurie, getting up and
striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the
rapturous, as Amy&#39;s voice was heard calling, &quot;Where is she? Where&#39;s my
dear old Jo?&quot;

In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all
over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were
set down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and
hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign
tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the
old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier
than ever.  It was good to see him beam at &#39;my children&#39;, as he called
the young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly
duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,
to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying
the pretty picture they made.

The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own
dress hadn&#39;t a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely
eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that &#39;her ladyship&#39; was altogether
a most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the
pair, &quot;How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found
the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than
clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.&quot;  Mrs. March and
her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they
saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but
the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.

For Amy&#39;s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a
peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,
prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and
winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of
her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for
it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true
gentlewoman she had hoped to become.

&quot;Love has done much for our little girl,&quot; said her mother softly.

&quot;She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,&quot; Mr.
March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head
beside him.

Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her &#39;pitty aunty&#39;, but
attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of
delightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before
he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took
the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank
movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew
where to have him.

&quot;Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you
hit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,&quot; and
with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew
in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted
his boyish soul.

&quot;Blest if she ain&#39;t in silk from head to foot; ain&#39;t it a relishin&#39;
sight to see her settin&#39; there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks
calling little Amy &#39;Mis.  Laurence!&#39;&quot; muttered old Hannah, who could
not resist frequent &quot;peeks&quot; through the slide as she set the table in a
most decidedly promiscuous manner.

Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all
burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half
an hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and
provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they
had gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into
the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.
March as proudly leaned on the arm of &#39;my son&#39;. The old gentleman took
Jo, with a whispered, &quot;You must be my girl now,&quot; and a glance at the
empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, &quot;I&#39;ll try to fill
her place, sir.&quot;

The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for
everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at
their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the
opportunity.  Didn&#39;t they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad
libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn&#39;t
they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,
there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human
nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness
of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo&#39;s sharp eyes would
pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,
the little sinners attached themselves to &#39;Dranpa&#39;, who hadn&#39;t his
spectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned
to the parlor on Father Laurence&#39;s arm.  The others paired off as
before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind
it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah&#39;s eager inquiry.

&quot;Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver
dishes that&#39;s stored away over yander?&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,
and wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too
good for her,&quot; returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.

&quot;No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?&quot;
asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an
uncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party
vanishing above, and as Demi&#39;s short plaid legs toiled up the last
stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she
looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,
for even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift
was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to
herself, &quot;I&#39;ll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won&#39;t do to be
dismal now.&quot;  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her
boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had
just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch
door.

She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had
come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming
on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.

&quot;Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!&quot; cried Jo, with a clutch, as
if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him
in.

&quot;And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,&quot; and the Professor
paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to
them.

&quot;No, we haven&#39;t, only the family.  My sister and friends have just come
home, and we are all very happy.  Come in, and make one of us.&quot;

Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously
away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the
door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had
something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,
and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary
man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.

&quot;If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.
You haf been ill, my friend?&quot;

He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light
fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.

&quot;Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you
last.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,&quot; and he
shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no
comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,
warm hand.

&quot;Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,&quot; she said, with a
face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might
as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.

If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at
rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted
him kindly, for Jo&#39;s sake at first, but very soon they liked him for
his own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that
opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,
feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty
enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly
hospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a
traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself
at home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and
establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by
rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,
with juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one
another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,
opened his choicest stores for his guest&#39;s benefit, while silent John
listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence
found it impossible to go to sleep.

If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie&#39;s behavior would have
amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like
suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe
the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.
He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn
into the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,
and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at
him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting
his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his
eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered
the mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take
care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept
them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.

A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water
after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several
propitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer&#39;s face had lost the absent-minded
expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,
actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him
with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.
Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the
ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be
considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when
Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she
watched her father&#39;s absorbed face, &quot;How he would enjoy having such a
man as my Professor to talk with every day!&quot;  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was
dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a
gentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,
but didn&#39;t stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it
up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect
better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a
Jove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she
sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even
the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his
immaculate wristbands.

&quot;Dear old fellow!  He couldn&#39;t have got himself up with more care if
he&#39;d been going a-wooing,&quot; said Jo to herself, and then a sudden
thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to
drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.

The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for
though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor
dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the
little blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,
saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to
resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.

Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted
the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.
Laurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking
away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal
mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of
bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of
matches, made a move to go.

&quot;We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together
again once more,&quot; said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe
and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.

They were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or
untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,
invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the
household league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in
its old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left
unfinished when the needle grew &#39;so heavy&#39;, was still on its accustomed
shelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,
and above it Beth&#39;s face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,
looked down upon them, seeming to say, &quot;Be happy.  I am here.&quot;

&quot;Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,&quot; said
Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.

But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, &quot;Not
tonight, dear.  I can&#39;t show off tonight.&quot;

But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she
sang Beth&#39;s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best
master could not have taught, and touched the listener&#39;s hearts with a
sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The
room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last
line of Beth&#39;s favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...

    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;

and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that
her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth&#39;s kiss.

&quot;Now, we must finish with Mignon&#39;s song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,&quot;
said Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his
throat with a gratified &quot;Hem!&quot; as he stepped into the corner where Jo
stood, saying...

&quot;You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together.&quot;

A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a
grasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a
whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.
It didn&#39;t much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily
and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might
listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.

    Know&#39;st thou the land where the citron blooms,

used to be the Professor&#39;s favorite line, for &#39;das land&#39; meant Germany
to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,
upon the words...

    There, oh there, might I with thee,
    O, my beloved, go

and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she
longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither
whenever he liked.

The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered
with laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners
entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been
introduced simply as &#39;my sister&#39;, and no one had called her by her new
name since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,
in his most gracious manner, at parting...

&quot;My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that
there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.&quot;

Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly
illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most
delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.

&quot;I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me
leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here
some days.&quot;

He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother&#39;s voice
gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter&#39;s eyes, for Mrs. March
was not so blind to her children&#39;s interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.

&quot;I suspect that is a wise man,&quot; remarked Mr. March, with placid
satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.

&quot;I know he is a good one,&quot; added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as
she wound up the clock.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like him,&quot; was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her
bed.

She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,
and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,
somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact.  If she had
seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a
severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to
be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon
the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the
picture in the dark.



CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR

MY LORD AND LADY

&quot;Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour?  The
luggage has come, and I&#39;ve been making hay of Amy&#39;s Paris finery,
trying to find some things I want,&quot; said Laurie, coming in the next day
to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother&#39;s lap, as if being made
&#39;the baby&#39; again.

&quot;Certainly.  Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,&quot; and
Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if
asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have come over if I could have helped it, but I can&#39;t get
on without my little woman any more than a...&quot;

&quot;Weathercock can without the wind,&quot; suggested Jo, as he paused for a
simile.  Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came
home.

&quot;Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with
only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven&#39;t had an
easterly spell since I was married.  Don&#39;t know anything about the
north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?&quot;

&quot;Lovely weather so far.  I don&#39;t know how long it will last, but I&#39;m
not afraid of storms, for I&#39;m learning how to sail my ship.  Come home,
dear, and I&#39;ll find your bootjack.  I suppose that&#39;s what you are
rummaging after among my things.  Men are so helpless, Mother,&quot; said
Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.

&quot;What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?&quot; asked
Jo, buttoning Amy&#39;s cloak as she used to button her pinafores.

&quot;We have our plans.  We don&#39;t mean to say much about them yet, because
we are such very new brooms, but we don&#39;t intend to be idle.  I&#39;m going
into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove
to him that I&#39;m not spoiled.  I need something of the sort to keep me
steady.  I&#39;m tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.&quot;

&quot;And Amy, what is she going to do?&quot; asked Mrs. March, well pleased at
Laurie&#39;s decision and the energy with which he spoke.

&quot;After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall
astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant
society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall
exert over the world at large.  That&#39;s about it, isn&#39;t it, Madame
Recamier?&quot; asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.

&quot;Time will show.  Come away, Impertinence, and don&#39;t shock my family by
calling me names before their faces,&quot; answered Amy, resolving that
there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon
as a queen of society.

&quot;How happy those children seem together!&quot; observed Mr. March, finding
it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple
had gone.

&quot;Yes, and I think it will last,&quot; added Mrs. March, with the restful
expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.

&quot;I know it will.  Happy Amy!&quot; and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as
Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.

Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the
bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, &quot;Mrs. Laurence.&quot;

&quot;My Lord!&quot;

&quot;That man intends to marry our Jo!&quot;

&quot;I hope so, don&#39;t you, dear?&quot;

&quot;Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that
expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal
richer.&quot;

&quot;Now, Laurie, don&#39;t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love
one another it doesn&#39;t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.
Women never should marry for money...&quot; Amy caught herself up short as
the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with
malicious gravity...

&quot;Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend
to do it sometimes.  If my memory serves me, you once thought it your
duty to make a rich match.  That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a
good-for-nothing like me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, my dearest boy, don&#39;t, don&#39;t say that!  I forgot you were rich
when I said &#39;Yes&#39;.  I&#39;d have married you if you hadn&#39;t a penny, and I
sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.&quot;
And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,
gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.

&quot;You don&#39;t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be
once, do you?  It would break my heart if you didn&#39;t believe that I&#39;d
gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your
living by rowing on the lake.&quot;

&quot;Am I an idiot and a brute?  How could I think so, when you refused a
richer man for me, and won&#39;t let me give you half I want to now, when I
have the right?  Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to
think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and
though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the
daughter was true to the mother&#39;s teaching.  I told Mamma so yesterday,
and she looked as glad and grateful as if I&#39;d given her a check for a
million, to be spent in charity.  You are not listening to my moral
remarks, Mrs. Laurence,&quot; and Laurie paused, for Amy&#39;s eyes had an
absent look, though fixed upon his face.

&quot;Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.  I
don&#39;t wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I&#39;m prouder of my
handsome husband than of all his money. Don&#39;t laugh, but your nose is
such a comfort to me,&quot; and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature
with artistic satisfaction.

Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that
suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his
wife&#39;s peculiar taste, while she said slowly, &quot;May I ask you a
question, dear?&quot;

&quot;Of course, you may.&quot;

&quot;Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s the trouble is it?  I thought there was something in the
dimple that didn&#39;t quite suit you.  Not being a dog in the manger, but
the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo&#39;s wedding
with a heart as light as my heels.  Do you doubt it, my darling?&quot;

Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.  Her little jealous fear
vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and
confidence.

&quot;I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn&#39;t
we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in
Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?&quot; said Laurie, when they
began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they
were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.

&quot;Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.  She is very proud of him,
just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a
beautiful thing.&quot;

&quot;Bless her dear heart!  She won&#39;t think so when she has a literary
husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support.  We
won&#39;t interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in
spite of themselves.  I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she
believes in people&#39;s paying their honest debts, so I&#39;ll get round her
in that way.&quot;

&quot;How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn&#39;t it? That was
always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks
to you, the dream has come true.&quot;

&quot;Ah, we&#39;ll do quantities of good, won&#39;t we?  There&#39;s one sort of
poverty that I particularly like to help.  Out-and-out beggars get
taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won&#39;t
ask, and people don&#39;t dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand
ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that
it does not offend.  I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman
better than a blarnerying beggar.  I suppose it&#39;s wrong, but I do,
though it is harder.&quot;

&quot;Because it takes a gentleman to do it,&quot; added the other member of the
domestic admiration society.

&quot;Thank you, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t deserve that pretty compliment. But I
was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good
many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and
enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid
fellows, some of them, working like heros,  poor and friendless, but so
full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,
and longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it&#39;s
a satisfaction to help, for if they&#39;ve got genius, it&#39;s an honor to be
allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of
fuel to keep the pot boiling.  If they haven&#39;t, it&#39;s a pleasure to
comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it
out.&quot;

&quot;Yes, indeed, and there&#39;s another class who can&#39;t ask, and who suffer
in silence.  I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you
made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old
story.  Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see
youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a
little help at the right minute.  People have been very kind to me, and
whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put
out my hand and help them, as I was helped.&quot;

&quot;And so you shall, like an angel as you are!&quot; cried Laurie, resolving,
with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution
for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies.  &quot;Rich
people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their
money accumulate for others to waste.  It&#39;s not half so sensible to
leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while
alive, and enjoy making one&#39;s fellow creatures happy with it.  We&#39;ll
have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure
by giving other people a generous taste.  Will you be a little Dorcas,
going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with
good deeds?&quot;

&quot;With all my heart, if you will be a brave St.  Martin, stopping as you
ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!&quot;

So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,
feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped
to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more
uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough
ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely
knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest
than they.



CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE

DAISY AND DEMI

I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March
family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious
and important members of it.  Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years
of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert
their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their
elders do.  If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being
utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.  Of
course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be
shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently
at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and
behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy
demanded a &#39;needler&#39;, and actually made a bag with four stitches in it.
She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a
microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to
Hannah&#39;s eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who
invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with
his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.  The boy
early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and
distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw,
and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his &#39;sewinsheen&#39;, a
mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for
wheels to go &#39;wound and wound&#39;.  Also a basket hung over the back of a
chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,
with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till
rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, &quot;Why, Marmar,
dat&#39;s my lellywaiter, and me&#39;s trying to pull her up.&quot;

Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well
together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day.  Of course, Demi
tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other
aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her
brother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,
sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody&#39;s heart,
and nestled there.  One of the captivating children, who seem made to
be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and
produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small
virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few
small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human.  It was all
fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the
window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether
it rained or shone, &quot;Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!&quot; Everyone was a
friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the
most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful
worshipers.

&quot;Me loves evvybody,&quot; she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in
one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish
the whole world.

As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be
blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which
had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be
spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had
entertained an angel unawares.  Her grandfather often called her
&#39;Beth&#39;, and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as
if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own
could see.

Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know
everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get
satisfactory answers to his perpetual &quot;What for?&quot;

He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his
grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which
the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised
satisfaction of the womenfolk.

&quot;What makes my legs go, Dranpa?&quot; asked the young philosopher, surveying
those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting
after a go-to-bed frolic one night.

&quot;It&#39;s your little mind, Demi,&quot; replied the sage, stroking the yellow
head respectfully.

&quot;What is a little mine?&quot;

&quot;It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the
wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.&quot;

&quot;Open me.  I want to see it go wound.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that any more than you could open the watch.  God winds you
up, and you go till He stops you.&quot;

&quot;Does I?&quot; and Demi&#39;s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the
new thought.  &quot;Is I wounded up like the watch?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I can&#39;t show you how, for it is done when we don&#39;t see.&quot;

Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch,
and then gravely remarked, &quot;I dess Dod does it when I&#39;s asleep.&quot;

A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively
that his anxious grandmother said, &quot;My dear, do you think it wise to
talk about such things to that baby?  He&#39;s getting great bumps over his
eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.&quot;

&quot;If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive
true answers.  I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping
him unfold those already there.  These children are wiser than we are,
and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.
Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.&quot;

If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, &quot;By the gods, Socrates, I
cannot tell,&quot; his grandfather would not have been surprised, but when,
after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he
answered, in a tone of calm conviction, &quot;In my little belly,&quot; the old
gentleman could only join in Grandma&#39;s laugh, and dismiss the class in
metaphysics.

There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given
convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding
philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to
prophesy, with ominous nods, &quot;That child ain&#39;t long for this world,&quot; he
would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with
which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their
parent&#39;s souls.

Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was
ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the
tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show
themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?

&quot;No more raisins, Demi.  They&#39;ll make you sick,&quot; says Mamma to the
young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing
regularity on plum-pudding day.

&quot;Me likes to be sick.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.&quot;

He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and
by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits Mamma
by a shrewd bargain.

&quot;Now you have been good children, and I&#39;ll play anything you like,&quot;
says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding
is safely bouncing in the pot.

&quot;Truly, Marmar?&quot; asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered
head.

&quot;Yes, truly.  Anything you say,&quot; replies the shortsighted parent,
preparing herself to sing, &quot;The Three Little Kittens&quot; half a dozen
times over, or to take her family to &quot;Buy a penny bun,&quot; regardless of
wind or limb.  But Demi corners her by the cool reply...

&quot;Then we&#39;ll go and eat up all the raisins.&quot;

Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the
trio turned the little house topsy-turvy.  Aunt Amy was as yet only a
name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but
Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for
which compliment she was deeply grateful.  But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo
neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their
little souls.  Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost
her best customer and became bankrupt.  Demi, with infantile
penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with &#39;the bear-man&#39;
better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for
he hadn&#39;t the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate
drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of
its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.

Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes,
but Demi didn&#39;t see it in that light, and continued to patronize the
&#39;the bear-man&#39; with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small
affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her
throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures surpassing worth.

Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the
young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this
counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not
deceive anybody a particle.  Mr. Bhaer&#39;s devotion was sincere, however
likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.
He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked
particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his
manly one.  His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to
day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always
asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.  The excellent
papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long
discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more
observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.

Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,
astonished by the spectacle that met his eye.  Prone upon the floor lay
Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,
likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own
short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed
that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his
sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face...

&quot;Father, Father, here&#39;s the Professor!&quot;

Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor
said, with undisturbed dignity, &quot;Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for
a moment.  We are just finishing our lesson.  Now, Demi, make the
letter and tell its name.&quot;

&quot;I knows him!&quot; and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took
the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil
triumphantly shouted, &quot;It&#39;s a We, Dranpa, it&#39;s a We!&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a born Weller,&quot; laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up,
and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of
expressing his satisfaction that school was over.

&quot;What have you been at today, bubchen?&quot; asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the
gymnast.

&quot;Me went to see little Mary.&quot;

&quot;And what did you there?&quot;

&quot;I kissed her,&quot; began Demi, with artless frankness.

&quot;Prut!  Thou beginnest early.  What did the little Mary say to that?&quot;
asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon
the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.

&quot;Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it.  Don&#39;t little
boys like little girls?&quot; asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of
bland satisfaction.

&quot;You precocious chick!  Who put that into your head?&quot; said Jo, enjoying
the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.

&quot;&#39;Tisn&#39;t in mine head, it&#39;s in mine mouf,&quot; answered literal Demi,
putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she
alluded to confectionery, not ideas.

&quot;Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.  Sweets to the sweet,
mannling,&quot; and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her
wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods.  Demi also
saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired.  ..

&quot;Do great boys like great girls, to, &#39;Fessor?&quot;

Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer &#39;couldn&#39;t tell a lie&#39;, so he gave the
somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone
that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at Jo&#39;s retiring
face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the &#39;precocious
chick&#39; had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.

Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour
afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a
tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she
followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big
slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi
puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.



CHAPTER FORTY-SIX

UNDER THE UMBRELLA

While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,
as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.
Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy
roads and sodden fields.

&quot;I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don&#39;t know why I should
give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way
out,&quot; said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though
there were two paths to Meg&#39;s whichever one she took she was sure to
meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and
never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his
short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till
that moment.  Then, if she was going to Meg&#39;s he always had something
for the babies.  If her face was turned homeward, he had merely
strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they
were tired of his frequent calls.

Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and
invite him in?  If she was tired of his visits, she concealed her
weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee
for supper, &quot;as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn&#39;t like tea.&quot;

By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet
everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in
Jo&#39;s face.  They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her
hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise.
And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer,
while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter
lessons in love.

Jo couldn&#39;t even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried
to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated
life.  She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,
after her many and vehement declarations of independence.  Laurie was
her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with
praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer &#39;a capital old fellow&#39;
in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo&#39;s improved
appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor&#39;s
hat on the Marches&#39; table nearly every evening.  But he exulted in
private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece
of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat
of arms.

For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like
regularity.  Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no
sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to
become pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very cross.

&quot;Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It&#39;s
nothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have come and bid
us goodbye like a gentleman,&quot; she said to herself, with a despairing
look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one
dull afternoon.

&quot;You&#39;d better take the little umbrella, dear.  It looks like rain,&quot;
said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not
alluding to the fact.

&quot;Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town?  I&#39;ve got to run in and get
some paper,&quot; returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the
glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.

&quot;Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and
two yards of narrow lavender ribbon.  Have you got your thick boots on,
and something warm under your cloak?&quot;

&quot;I believe so,&quot; answered Jo absently.

&quot;If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long
to see the dear man,&quot; added Mrs. March.

Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk
rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her
heartache, &quot;How good she is to me! What do girls do who haven&#39;t any
mothers to help them through their troubles?&quot;

The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks,
and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo
found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand,
loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering
instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most
unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by
descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as
if they wondered &#39;how the deuce she got there&#39;.  A drop of rain on her
cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons.  For
the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she
felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her
bonnet.  Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had
forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing,
and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching.  She
looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked
with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering
look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with &#39;Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp;
Co.&#39; over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful
air...

&quot;It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things
and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor?  Jo, I&#39;m
ashamed of you!  No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or
find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do
your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your
bonnet, it&#39;s no more than you deserve.  Now then!&quot;

With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly
escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself
into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, &quot;I beg pardon,
ma&#39;am,&quot; and looked mortally offended.  Somewhat daunted, Jo righted
herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting
temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the
ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead.  The fact that a
somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected
bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer
looking down.

&quot;I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many
horse noses, and so fast through much mud.  What do you down here, my
friend?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m shopping.&quot;

Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to
the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said
politely, &quot;You haf no umbrella.  May I go also, and take for you the
bundles?&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;

Jo&#39;s cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought
of her, but she didn&#39;t care, for in a minute she found herself walking
away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly
burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,
and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that
day.

&quot;We thought you had gone,&quot; said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking
at her.  Her bonnet wasn&#39;t big enough to hide her face, and she feared
he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.

&quot;Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf
been so heavenly kind to me?&quot; he asked so reproachfully that she felt
as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily...

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t.  I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we
rather missed you, Father and Mother especially.&quot;

&quot;And you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m always glad to see you, sir.&quot;

In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,
and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the
Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...

&quot;I thank you, and come one more time before I go.&quot;

&quot;You are going, then?&quot;

&quot;I haf no longer any business here, it is done.&quot;

&quot;Successfully, I hope?&quot; said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment
was in that short reply of his.

&quot;I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make
my bread and gif my Junglings much help.&quot;

&quot;Tell me, please!  I like to know all about the--the boys,&quot; said Jo
eagerly.

&quot;That is so kind, I gladly tell you.  My friends find for me a place in
a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way
smooth for Franz and Emil.  For this I should be grateful, should I
not?&quot;

&quot;Indeed you should.  How splendid it will be to have you doing what you
like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!&quot; cried Jo, clinging
to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help
betraying.

&quot;Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.&quot;

&quot;So far away!&quot; and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn&#39;t
matter now what became of her clothes or herself.

Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read
women yet.  He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,
therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and
manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was
in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When
she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help
suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered
her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but
when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply
that despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost
clapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his
destination, she said, &quot;So far away!&quot; in a tone of despair that lifted
him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down
again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...

&quot;Here&#39;s the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won&#39;t take
long.&quot;

Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and
particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and
dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the
flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of
needles, forgot the silesia was to be &#39;twilled&#39; till it was cut off,
gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for
lavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching
her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed
to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,
like dreams, go by contraries.

When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more
cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather
enjoyed it on the whole.

&quot;Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and
haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so
pleasant home?&quot; he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and
flowers.

&quot;What will we buy?&quot; asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,
and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they
went in.

&quot;May they haf oranges and figs?&quot; asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.

&quot;They eat them when they can get them.&quot;

&quot;Do you care for nuts?&quot;

&quot;Like a squirrel.&quot;

&quot;Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?&quot;

Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn&#39;t buy
a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done
with it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,
and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of
rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of
a demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and
giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they
traveled on again.

&quot;Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,&quot; began the Professor,
after a moist promenade of half a block.

&quot;Yes, sir?&quot; and Jo&#39;s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he
would hear it.

&quot;I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time
remains to me.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden
squeeze she gave it.

&quot;I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go
alone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had
stepped into a refrigerator.

&quot;Perhaps also a shawl for Tina&#39;s mother, she is so poor and sick, and
the husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a
friendly thing to take the little mother.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m going very fast, and he&#39;s
getting dearer every minute,&quot; added Jo to herself, then with a mental
shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to
behold.

Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and
then ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,
condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be
shopping for their family.

&quot;Your lady may prefer this.  It&#39;s a superior article, a most desirable
color, quite chaste and genteel,&quot; he said, shaking out a comfortable
gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?&quot; she asked, turning her back to him,
and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.

&quot;Excellently well, we will haf it,&quot; answered the Professor, smiling to
himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters
like a confirmed bargain-hunter.

&quot;Now shall we go home?&quot; he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to
him.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s late, and I&#39;m _so_ tired.&quot; Jo&#39;s voice was more pathetic than
she knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it
came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the
first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and
that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the
latter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,
it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this
idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty
gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.

&quot;This is not our omniboos,&quot; said the Professor, waving the loaded
vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.

&quot;I beg your pardon.  I didn&#39;t see the name distinctly.  Never mind, I
can walk.  I&#39;m used to plodding in the mud,&quot; returned Jo, winking hard,
because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.

Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away.
The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he
asked in a tone that meant a great deal, &quot;Heart&#39;s dearest, why do you
cry?&quot;

Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said
she wasn&#39;t crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine
fib proper to the occasion.  Instead of which, that undignified
creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, &quot;Because you are going
away.&quot;

&quot;Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!&quot; cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp
his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, &quot;Jo, I haf nothing
but much love to gif you.  I came to see if you could care for it, and
I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?
Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?&quot; he added, all
in one breath.

&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both
hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that
plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,
even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he
carried it.

It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had
desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on
account of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except
figuratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender
remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only
way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an
expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there
actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his
beard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don&#39;t think he could have
done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a
deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her
bonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most
beautiful woman living, and she found him more &quot;Jove-like&quot; than ever,
though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling
thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and
every finger of his gloves needed mending.

Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they
entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious
of deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for
they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any
life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the
plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of
heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the
world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo
trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and
wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she
was the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks
which followed her impetuous &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; were not of a coherent or
reportable character.

&quot;Friedrich, why didn&#39;t you...&quot;

&quot;Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!&quot;
cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful
delight.

&quot;I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won&#39;t unless you like
it.&quot;

&quot;Like it?  It is more sweet to me than I can tell.  Say &#39;thou&#39;, also,
and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t &#39;thou&#39; a little sentimental?&quot; asked Jo, privately thinking it a
lovely monosyllable.

&quot;Sentimental? Yes.  Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and
keep ourselves young mit it.  Your English &#39;you&#39; is so cold, say
&#39;thou&#39;, heart&#39;s dearest, it means so much to me,&quot; pleaded Mr. Bhaer,
more like a romantic student than a grave professor.

&quot;Well, then, why didn&#39;t thou tell me all this sooner?&quot; asked Jo
bashfully.

&quot;Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,
because thou must take care of it hereafter.  See, then, my Jo--ah, the
dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something the day I said
goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to
thee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said &#39;Yes&#39;, then, if I had
spoken?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m afraid not, for I didn&#39;t have any heart just then.&quot;

&quot;Prut!  That I do not believe.  It was asleep till the fairy prince
came through the wood, and waked it up.  Ah, well, &#39;Die erste Liebe ist
die beste&#39;, but that I should not expect.&quot;

&quot;Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had
another.  Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,&quot;
said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor&#39;s mistake.

&quot;Good!  Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all.
I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,
Professorin.&quot;

&quot;I like that,&quot; cried Jo, delighted with her new name.  &quot;Now tell me
what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?&quot;

&quot;This,&quot; and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat
pocket.

Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own
contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her
sending it an occasional attempt.

&quot;How could that bring you?&quot; she asked, wondering what he meant.

&quot;I found it by chance.  I knew it by the names and the initials, and in
it there was one little verse that seemed to call me.  Read and find
him.  I will see that you go not in the wet.&quot;


    IN THE GARRET

    Four little chests all in a row,
    Dim with dust, and worn by time,
    All fashioned and filled, long ago,
    By children now in their prime.
    Four little keys hung side by side,
    With faded ribbons, brave and gay
    When fastened there, with childish pride,
    Long ago, on a rainy day.
    Four little names, one on each lid,
    Carved out by a boyish hand,
    And underneath there lieth hid
    Histories of the happy band
    Once playing here, and pausing oft
    To hear the sweet refrain,
    That came and went on the roof aloft,
    In the falling summer rain.

    &quot;Meg&quot; on the first lid, smooth and fair.
    I look in with loving eyes,
    For folded here, with well-known care,
    A goodly gathering lies,
    The record of a peaceful life--
    Gifts to gentle child and girl,
    A bridal gown, lines to a wife,
    A tiny shoe, a baby curl.
    No toys in this first chest remain,
    For all are carried away,
    In their old age, to join again
    In another small Meg&#39;s play.
    Ah, happy mother!  Well I know
    You hear, like a sweet refrain,
    Lullabies ever soft and low
    In the falling summer rain.

    &quot;Jo&quot; on the next lid, scratched and worn,
    And within a motley store
    Of headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,
    Birds and beasts that speak no more,
    Spoils brought home from the fairy ground
    Only trod by youthful feet,
    Dreams of a future never found,
    Memories of a past still sweet,
    Half-writ poems, stories wild,
    April letters, warm and cold,
    Diaries of a wilful child,
    Hints of a woman early old,
    A woman in a lonely home,
    Hearing, like a sad refrain--
    &quot;Be worthy, love, and love will come,&quot;
    In the falling summer rain.

    My Beth!  the dust is always swept
    From the lid that bears your name,
    As if by loving eyes that wept,
    By careful hands that often came.
    Death canonized for us one saint,
    Ever less human than divine,
    And still we lay, with tender plaint,
    Relics in this household shrine--
    The silver bell, so seldom rung,
    The little cap which last she wore,
    The fair, dead Catherine that hung
    By angels borne above her door.
    The songs she sang, without lament,
    In her prison-house of pain,
    Forever are they sweetly blent
    With the falling summer rain.

    Upon the last lid&#39;s polished field--
    Legend now both fair and true
    A gallant knight bears on his shield,
    &quot;Amy&quot; in letters gold and blue.
    Within lie snoods that bound her hair,
    Slippers that have danced their last,
    Faded flowers laid by with care,
    Fans whose airy toils are past,
    Gay valentines, all ardent flames,
    Trifles that have borne their part
    In girlish hopes and fears and shames,
    The record of a maiden heart
    Now learning fairer, truer spells,
    Hearing, like a blithe refrain,
    The silver sound of bridal bells
    In the falling summer rain.

    Four little chests all in a row,
    Dim with dust, and worn by time,
    Four women, taught by weal and woe
    To love and labor in their prime.
    Four sisters, parted for an hour,
    None lost, one only gone before,
    Made by love&#39;s immortal power,
    Nearest and dearest evermore.
    Oh, when these hidden stores of ours
    Lie open to the Father&#39;s sight,
    May they be rich in golden hours,
    Deeds that show fairer for the light,
    Lives whose brave music long shall ring,
    Like a spirit-stirring strain,
    Souls that shall gladly soar and sing
    In the long sunshine after rain.

&quot;It&#39;s very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I
was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag.  I never thought it
would go where it could tell tales,&quot; said Jo, tearing up the verses the
Professor had treasured so long.

&quot;Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I
read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,&quot; said
Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the
wind.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he added earnestly, &quot;I read that, and I think to myself,
She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love.
I haf a heart full, full for her.  Shall I not go and say, &#39;If this is
not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it
in Gott&#39;s name?&#39;&quot;

&quot;And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious
thing I needed,&quot; whispered Jo.

&quot;I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your
welcome to me.  But soon I began to hope, and then I said, &#39;I will haf
her if I die for it,&#39; and so I will!&quot; cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant
nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he
was to surmount or valiantly knock down.

Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,
though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.

&quot;What made you stay away so long?&quot; she asked presently, finding it so
pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that
she could not keep silent.

&quot;It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that
so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after
much time, perhaps, and hard work.  How could I ask you to gif up so
much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you are poor.  I couldn&#39;t bear a rich husband,&quot; said Jo
decidedly, adding in a softer tone, &quot;Don&#39;t fear poverty. I&#39;ve known it
long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and
don&#39;t call yourself old--forty is the prime of life.  I couldn&#39;t help
loving you if you were seventy!&quot;

The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of
his handkerchief, if he could have got at it.  As he couldn&#39;t, Jo wiped
his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or
two...

&quot;I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I&#39;m out of my sphere now,
for woman&#39;s special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing
burdens.  I&#39;m to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.
Make up your mind to that, or I&#39;ll never go,&quot; she added resolutely, as
he tried to reclaim his load.

&quot;We shall see.  Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go
away and do my work alone.  I must help my boys first, because, even
for you, I may not break my word to Minna.  Can you forgif that, and be
happy while we hope and wait?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the
rest easy to bear.  I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn&#39;t enjoy
myself if I neglected them even for you, so there&#39;s no need of hurry or
impatience.  You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and
both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God
wills.&quot;

&quot;Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif
back but a full heart and these empty hands,&quot; cried the Professor,
quite overcome.

Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they
stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering
tenderly, &quot;Not empty now,&quot; and stooping down, kissed her Friedrich
under the umbrella.  It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the
flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,
for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything
but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that
was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the
night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and
peace waiting to receive them, with a glad &quot;Welcome home!&quot;  Jo led her
lover in, and shut the door.



CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN

HARVEST TIME

For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met
occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the
price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.  The second year began
rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March
died suddenly.  But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved
the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause
for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts
of joyful things possible.

&quot;It&#39;s a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course
you intend to sell it,&quot; said Laurie, as they were all talking the
matter over some weeks later.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; was Jo&#39;s decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,
whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.

&quot;You don&#39;t mean to live there?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;

&quot;But, my dear girl, it&#39;s an immense house, and will take a power of
money to keep it in order.  The garden and orchard alone need two or
three men, and farming isn&#39;t in Bhaer&#39;s line, I take it.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.&quot;

&quot;And you expect to live on the produce of the place?  Well, that sounds
paradisiacal, but you&#39;ll find it desperate hard work.&quot;

&quot;The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,&quot; and Jo laughed.

&quot;Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Boys.  I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy,
homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a truly Joian plan for you!  Isn&#39;t that just like her?&quot; cried
Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.

&quot;I like it,&quot; said Mrs. March decidedly.

&quot;So do I,&quot; added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for
trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.

&quot;It will be an immense care for Jo,&quot; said Meg, stroking the head of her
one all-absorbing son.

&quot;Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It&#39;s a splendid idea. Tell us all
about it,&quot; cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers
a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.

&quot;I knew you&#39;d stand by me, sir.  Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,
though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she
speaks.  Now, my dear people,&quot; continued Jo earnestly, &quot;just understand
that this isn&#39;t a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan.  Before
my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I&#39;d made my fortune, and no
one needed me at home, I&#39;d hire a big house, and pick up some poor,
forlorn little lads who hadn&#39;t any mothers, and take care of them, and
make life jolly for them before it was too late.  I see so many going
to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything
for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their
troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!&quot;

Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in
her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not
seen for a long while.

&quot;I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would
like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.  Bless his dear heart,
he&#39;s been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting
rich, that he&#39;ll never be.  Money doesn&#39;t stay in his pocket long
enough to lay up any.  But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved
me better than I ever deserved, I&#39;m rich, at least I feel so, and we
can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.
It&#39;s just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture
strong and plain.  There&#39;s plenty of room for dozens inside, and
splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.
Such work is healthy, isn&#39;t it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach
in his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet
and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I&#39;ve always longed for
lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and
revel in the little dears to my heart&#39;s content.  Think what luxury--
Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.&quot;

As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off
into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought
he&#39;d have an apoplectic fit.

&quot;I don&#39;t see anything funny,&quot; she said gravely, when she could be
heard.  &quot;Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor
to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.&quot;

&quot;She is putting on airs already,&quot; said Laurie, who regarded the idea in
the light of a capital joke.  &quot;But may I inquire how you intend to
support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,
I&#39;m afraid your crop won&#39;t be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.
Bhaer.&quot;

&quot;Now don&#39;t be a wet-blanket, Teddy.  Of course I shall have rich
pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.  Then, when I&#39;ve got
a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich
people&#39;s children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I&#39;ve
seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones
pushed forward, when it&#39;s real cruelty.  Some are naughty through
mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best
have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that&#39;s the very time they
need most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them
about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at
once from pretty children into fine young men.  They don&#39;t complain
much--plucky little souls--but they feel it.  I&#39;ve been through
something of it, and I know all about it. I&#39;ve a special interest in
such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,
well-meaning boys&#39; hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the
topsy-turvy heads.  I&#39;ve had experience, too, for haven&#39;t I brought up
one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll testify that you tried to do it,&quot; said Laurie with a grateful
look.

&quot;And I&#39;ve succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,
sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying
up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not
merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them
yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.
I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone
feels it, though you won&#39;t let them say so.  Yes, and when I have my
flock, I&#39;ll just point to you, and say &#39;There&#39;s your model, my lads&#39;.&quot;

Poor Laurie didn&#39;t know where to look, for, man though he was,
something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise
made all faces turn approvingly upon him.

&quot;I say, Jo, that&#39;s rather too much,&quot; he began, just in his old boyish
way.  &quot;You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,
except by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me
off lately, Jo, but I&#39;ve had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if
I&#39;ve got on at all, you may thank these two for it,&quot; and he laid one
hand gently on his grandfather&#39;s head, and the other on Amy&#39;s golden
one, for the three were never far apart.

&quot;I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the
world!&quot; burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind
just then.  &quot;When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as
the three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only
here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,&quot; she added more
quietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful
evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of
happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed
always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.

It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen
in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew
where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then
a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished
surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was
continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the
Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for
its support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,
and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.

Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but
the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most
rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her
&#39;wilderness of boys&#39;, and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented
had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered
Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!  There was a sort of
poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the
terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely
on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,
and played cricket in the big field where the irritable &#39;cow with a
crumpled horn&#39; used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed.  It
became a sort of boys&#39; paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be
called the &#39;Bhaer-garten&#39;, as a compliment to its master and
appropriate to its inhabitants.

It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a
fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--&#39;a happy, homelike
place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness&#39;.  Every room
in the big house was soon full.  Every little plot in the garden soon
had its owner.  A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet
animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz
from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy
young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding
words, and grateful hearts, full of love for &#39;Mother Bhaer&#39;.  She had
boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,
by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin
much trouble and anxiety.  But her faith in the good spot which exists
in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little
ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal
boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as
benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times
seven.  Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their
penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching
little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even
their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.
There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,
boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a
merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was
welcome to the &#39;Bhaer-garten&#39;, though some people predicted that his
admission would ruin the school.

Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much
anxiety, and a perpetual racket.  She enjoyed it heartily and found the
applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for
now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers
and admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to
increase her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a
happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa&#39;s sunshiny
temper as well as his mother&#39;s lively spirit.  How they ever grew up
alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and
aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough
nurses loved and served them well.

There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most
delightful was the yearly apple-picking.  For then the Marches,
Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day
of it.  Five years after Jo&#39;s wedding, one of these fruitful festivals
occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an
exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance
healthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.
Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped
briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a
feast.  Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.  Birds
twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree
stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the
first shake.  Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed
up and tumbled down.  Everybody declared that there never had been such
a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave
themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there
were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.

Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and
Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...

The gentle apple&#39;s winey juice.

The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout
Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made
a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the
way of ground and lofty tumbling.  Laurie devoted himself to the little
ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among
the bird&#39;s nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck.
Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,
sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a
beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups,
and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little
crutch beside him.

Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned
up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her
arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up.  Little Teddy
bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never
felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,
galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by
his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies
could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and
their own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in
time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back
with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.

At four o&#39;clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while
the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and
Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the
grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.
The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for
the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of
refreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the
boyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the
fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk
while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by
eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over
the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of
bird.  The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among
the edibles at his own sweet will.

When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first
regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--&quot;Aunt March, God
bless her!&quot;  A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot
how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been
taught to keep her memory green.

&quot;Now, Grandma&#39;s sixtieth birthday!  Long life to her, with three times
three!&quot;

That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering
once begun, it was hard to stop it.  Everybody&#39;s health was proposed,
from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the
astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search
of its young master.  Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented
the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were
transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,
some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were
ornaments to Grandma&#39;s--for the children&#39;s gifts were all their own.
Every stitch Daisy&#39;s patient little fingers had put into the
handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.
Demi&#39;s miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn&#39;t shut,
Rob&#39;s footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was
soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy&#39;s child gave her was so
fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--&quot;To dear
Grandma, from her little Beth.&quot;

During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when
Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while
Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to
sing.  Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and
from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys
sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie
set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best
effect.  This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand
success, for Mrs. March couldn&#39;t get over her surprise, and insisted on
shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz
and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.

After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and
her daughters under the festival tree.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever ought to call myself &#39;unlucky Jo&#39; again, when my
greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,&quot; said Mrs. Bhaer,
taking Teddy&#39;s little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was
rapturously churning.

&quot;And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long
ago.  Do you remember our castles in the air?&quot; asked Amy, smiling as
she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.

&quot;Dear fellows!  It does my heart good to see them forget business and
frolic for a day,&quot; answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all
mankind.  &quot;Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,
lonely, and cold to me now.  I haven&#39;t given up the hope that I may
write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I&#39;m sure it will be all the
better for such experiences and illustrations as these,&quot; and Jo pointed
from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the
Professor&#39;s arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one
of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her
mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in
her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face
which never could grow old to them.

&quot;My castle was the most nearly realized of all.  I asked for splendid
things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I
had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.  I&#39;ve
got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,&quot; and
Meg laid her hand on her tall boy&#39;s head, with a face full of tender
and devout content.

&quot;My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter
it, though, like Jo, I don&#39;t relinquish all my artistic hopes, or
confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty.  I&#39;ve
begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing
I&#39;ve ever done.  I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so
that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little
angel.&quot;

As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping
child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little
creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy&#39;s
sunshine.  This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for
one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy&#39;s nature was
growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.  Laurie was growing more
serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,
good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and
sorrow, from the most blessed for ...


    Into each life some rain must fall,
    Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.


&quot;She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.  Don&#39;t despond, but
hope and keep happy,&quot; said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped
from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin&#39;s pale
one.

&quot;I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie
to take more than half of every burden,&quot; replied Amy warmly.  &quot;He never
lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so
devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can&#39;t
love him enough.  So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg,
&#39;Thank God, I&#39;m a happy woman.&#39;&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I&#39;m far
happier than I deserve,&quot; added Jo, glancing from her good husband to
her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her.  &quot;Fritz is
getting gray and stout.  I&#39;m growing as thin as a shadow, and am
thirty.  We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,
for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under
the bed-clothes, though he&#39;s set himself afire three times already.
But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,
and never was so jolly in my life.  Excuse the remark, but living among
boys, I can&#39;t help using their expressions now and then.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,&quot; began Mrs. March,
frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of
countenance.

&quot;Not half so good as yours, Mother.  Here it is, and we never can thank
you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,&quot; cried Jo,
with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.

&quot;I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,&quot; said Amy
softly.

&quot;A large sheaf, but I know there&#39;s room in your heart for it, Marmee
dear,&quot; added Meg&#39;s tender voice.

Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if
to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and
voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility...

&quot;Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a
greater happiness than this!&quot;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.

&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; said his lady to him one day, &quot;have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?&quot;

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

&quot;But it is,&quot; returned she; &quot;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.&quot;

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

&quot;Do not you want to know who has taken it?&quot; cried his wife impatiently.

&quot;_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&quot;

This was invitation enough.

&quot;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.&quot;

&quot;What is his name?&quot;

&quot;Bingley.&quot;

&quot;Is he married or single?&quot;

&quot;Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&quot;

&quot;How so? how can it affect them?&quot;

&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; replied his wife, &quot;how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&quot;

&quot;Is that his design in settling here?&quot;

&quot;Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.&quot;

&quot;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party.&quot;

&quot;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty.&quot;

&quot;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&quot;

&quot;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.&quot;

&quot;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&quot;

&quot;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.&quot;

&quot;You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&quot;

&quot;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the
preference.&quot;

&quot;They have none of them much to recommend them,&quot; replied he; &quot;they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.&quot;

&quot;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.&quot;

&quot;Ah! you do not know what I suffer.&quot;

&quot;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&quot;

&quot;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them.&quot;

&quot;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.&quot;

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.




CHAPTER II.


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

&quot;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.&quot;

&quot;We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,&quot; said her mother
resentfully, &quot;since we are not to visit.&quot;

&quot;But you forget, mama,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.&quot;

&quot;No more have I,&quot; said Mr. Bennet; &quot;and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

&quot;Don&#39;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven&#39;s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.&quot;

&quot;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&quot; said her father; &quot;she times
them ill.&quot;

&quot;I do not cough for my own amusement,&quot; replied Kitty fretfully.

&quot;When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?&quot;

&quot;To-morrow fortnight.&quot;

&quot;Aye, so it is,&quot; cried her mother, &quot;and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself.&quot;

&quot;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.&quot;

&quot;Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?&quot;

&quot;I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&#39;s acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.&quot;

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &quot;Nonsense,
nonsense!&quot;

&quot;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&quot; cried he. &quot;Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great
books, and make extracts.&quot;

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

&quot;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&quot; he continued, &quot;let us return to Mr.
Bingley.&quot;

&quot;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&quot; cried his wife.

&quot;I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.&quot;

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

&quot;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now.&quot;

&quot;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,&quot; said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

&quot;What an excellent father you have, girls,&quot; said she, when the door was
shut. &quot;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; said Lydia stoutly, &quot;I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I&#39;m the tallest.&quot;

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet&#39;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.




CHAPTER III.


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley&#39;s heart were entertained.

&quot;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&quot;
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, &quot;and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.&quot;

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&#39;s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &amp;c. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.

&quot;Come, Darcy,&quot; said he, &quot;I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.&quot;

&quot;I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.&quot;

&quot;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&quot; cried Bingley, &quot;for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.&quot;

&quot;_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&quot; said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

&quot;Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&quot;

&quot;Which do you mean?&quot; and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
&quot;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.&quot;

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&#39;s
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife&#39;s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.

&quot;Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; as she entered the room, &quot;we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----&quot;

&quot;If he had had any compassion for _me_,&quot; cried her husband impatiently,
&quot;he would not have danced half so much! For God&#39;s sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!&quot;

&quot;Oh! my dear,&quot; continued Mrs. Bennet, &quot;I am quite delighted with him. He
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst&#39;s gown----&quot;

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

&quot;But I can assure you,&quot; she added, &quot;that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.&quot;




CHAPTER IV.


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.

&quot;He is just what a young man ought to be,&quot; said she, &quot;sensible, good
humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!&quot;

&quot;He is also handsome,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.&quot;

&quot;I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.&quot;

&quot;Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.&quot;

&quot;Dear Lizzy!&quot;

&quot;Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.&quot;

&quot;I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak
what I think.&quot;

&quot;I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body&#39;s character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man&#39;s sisters too,
do you? Their manners are not equal to his.&quot;

&quot;Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.&quot;

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother&#39;s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy&#39;s regard Bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In
understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,
but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.




CHAPTER V.


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James&#39;s had made him
courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth&#39;s intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

&quot;_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. &quot;_You_ were Mr. Bingley&#39;s first choice.&quot;

&quot;Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better.&quot;

&quot;Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson&#39;s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot;

&quot;Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.&quot;

&quot;_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,&quot; said
Charlotte. &quot;Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.&quot;

&quot;I beg you would not put it into Lizzy&#39;s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.&quot;

&quot;Are you quite sure, Ma&#39;am?--is not there a little mistake?&quot; said
Jane.--&quot;I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.&quot;

&quot;Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to.&quot;

&quot;Miss Bingley told me,&quot; said Jane, &quot;that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise.&quot;

&quot;I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,&quot; said Miss Lucas, &quot;but I
wish he had danced with Eliza.&quot;

&quot;Another time, Lizzy,&quot; said her mother, &quot;I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.&quot;

&quot;I believe, Ma&#39;am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.&quot;

&quot;His pride,&quot; said Miss Lucas, &quot;does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.&quot;

&quot;That is very true,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.&quot;

&quot;Pride,&quot; observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, &quot;is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.&quot;

&quot;If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,&quot; cried a young Lucas who came with his
sisters, &quot;I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.&quot;

&quot;Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,&quot; said Mrs.
Bennet; &quot;and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle
directly.&quot;

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.




CHAPTER VI.


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet&#39;s pleasing manners grew on the
good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother&#39;s admiration. It was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas.

&quot;It may perhaps be pleasant,&quot; replied Charlotte, &quot;to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.&quot;

&quot;But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.&quot;

&quot;Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane&#39;s disposition as you do.&quot;

&quot;But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses.&quot;

&quot;Your plan is a good one,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane&#39;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.&quot;

&quot;Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.&quot;

&quot;Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Charlotte, &quot;I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.&quot;

&quot;You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.&quot;

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley&#39;s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas&#39;s, where a large party were
assembled.

&quot;What does Mr. Darcy mean,&quot; said she to Charlotte, &quot;by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?&quot;

&quot;That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.&quot;

&quot;But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.&quot;

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

&quot;Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?&quot;

&quot;With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic.&quot;

&quot;You are severe on us.&quot;

&quot;It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,&quot; said Miss Lucas. &quot;I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.&quot;

&quot;You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.&quot; On Miss Lucas&#39;s persevering, however,
she added, &quot;Very well; if it must be so, it must.&quot; And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, &quot;There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--&#39;Keep your breath to cool your porridge,&#39;--and I
shall keep mine to swell my song.&quot;

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.

&quot;What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There
is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
dance.&quot;

Sir William only smiled. &quot;Your friend performs delightfully;&quot; he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--&quot;and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.&quot;

&quot;You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.&quot;

&quot;Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James&#39;s?&quot;

&quot;Never, sir.&quot;

&quot;Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?&quot;

&quot;It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.&quot;

&quot;You have a house in town, I conclude?&quot;

Mr. Darcy bowed.

&quot;I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.&quot;

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

&quot;My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.&quot;
And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

&quot;Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.&quot;

Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

&quot;You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Darcy is all politeness,&quot; said Elizabeth, smiling.

&quot;He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?&quot;

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

&quot;I can guess the subject of your reverie.&quot;

&quot;I should imagine not.&quot;

&quot;You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!&quot;

&quot;Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.&quot;

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

&quot;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.&quot;

&quot;Miss Elizabeth Bennet!&quot; repeated Miss Bingley. &quot;I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
joy?&quot;

&quot;That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&#39;s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.&quot;

&quot;Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.&quot;

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.




CHAPTER VII.


Mr. Bennet&#39;s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother&#39;s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner&#39;s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters&#39;, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
head quarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers&#39; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley&#39;s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,

&quot;From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.&quot;

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

&quot;I am astonished, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, &quot;that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of any body&#39;s children, it should not be of my own however.&quot;

&quot;If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.&quot;

&quot;Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.&quot;

&quot;This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.&quot;

&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&#39;s in his
regimentals.&quot;

&quot;Mama,&quot; cried Lydia, &quot;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&#39;s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&#39;s library.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet&#39;s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

&quot;Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.&quot;

&quot;It is from Miss Bingley,&quot; said Jane, and then read it aloud.

     &quot;My dear Friend,

     &quot;If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day&#39;s tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
     Yours ever,

     &quot;CAROLINE BINGLEY.&quot;

&quot;With the officers!&quot; cried Lydia. &quot;I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.&quot;

&quot;Dining out,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, &quot;that is very unlucky.&quot;

&quot;Can I have the carriage?&quot; said Jane.

&quot;No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.&quot;

&quot;That would be a good scheme,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.&quot;

&quot;Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley&#39;s chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.&quot;

&quot;I had much rather go in the coach.&quot;

&quot;But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?&quot;

&quot;They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.&quot;

&quot;But if you have got them to-day,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;my mother&#39;s purpose
will be answered.&quot;

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

&quot;This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

     &quot;My dearest Lizzy,

     &quot;I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.

     &quot;Yours, &amp;c.&quot;

&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, &quot;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&quot;

&quot;Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the
carriage.&quot;

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

&quot;How can you be so silly,&quot; cried her mother, &quot;as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.&quot;

&quot;I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.&quot;

&quot;Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,&quot; said her father, &quot;to send for the
horses?&quot;

&quot;No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.&quot;

&quot;I admire the activity of your benevolence,&quot; observed Mary, &quot;but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.&quot;

&quot;We will go as far as Meryton with you,&quot; said Catherine and
Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.

&quot;If we make haste,&quot; said Lydia, as they walked along, &quot;perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.&quot;

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers&#39; wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother&#39;s manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion&#39;s justifying her coming so far alone. The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.

Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.




CHAPTER VIII.


At five o&#39;clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley&#39;s, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
thought the same, and added,

&quot;She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.&quot;

&quot;She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!&quot;

&quot;Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office.&quot;

&quot;Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,&quot; said Bingley; &quot;but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice.&quot;

&quot;_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,&quot; said Miss Bingley; &quot;and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition.&quot;

&quot;Certainly not.&quot;

&quot;To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum.&quot;

&quot;It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,&quot; said
Bingley.

&quot;I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,&quot; observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
&quot;that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; he replied; &quot;they were brightened by the exercise.&quot;--A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.

&quot;I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it.&quot;

&quot;I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton.&quot;

&quot;Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.&quot;

&quot;That is capital,&quot; added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

&quot;If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,&quot; cried Bingley, &quot;it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.&quot;

&quot;But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,&quot; replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend&#39;s vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

&quot;Do you prefer reading to cards?&quot; said he; &quot;that is rather singular.&quot;

&quot;Miss Eliza Bennet,&quot; said Miss Bingley, &quot;despises cards. She is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else.&quot;

&quot;I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,&quot; cried Elizabeth; &quot;I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.&quot;

&quot;In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,&quot; said Bingley; &quot;and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.&quot;

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

&quot;And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever look into.&quot;

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

&quot;I am astonished,&quot; said Miss Bingley, &quot;that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!&quot;

&quot;It ought to be good,&quot; he replied, &quot;it has been the work of many
generations.&quot;

&quot;And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.&quot;

&quot;I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.&quot;

&quot;Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.&quot;

&quot;I wish it may.&quot;

&quot;But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.&quot;

&quot;With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.&quot;

&quot;I am talking of possibilities, Charles.&quot;

&quot;Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.&quot;

Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

&quot;Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?&quot; said Miss Bingley; &quot;will
she be as tall as I am?&quot;

&quot;I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet&#39;s height, or
rather taller.&quot;

&quot;How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite.&quot;

&quot;It is amazing to me,&quot; said Bingley, &quot;how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are.&quot;

&quot;All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished.&quot;

&quot;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&quot;

&quot;Nor I, I am sure,&quot; said Miss Bingley.

&quot;Then,&quot; observed Elizabeth, &quot;you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.&quot;

&quot;Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.&quot;

&quot;Oh! certainly,&quot; cried his faithful assistant, &quot;no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.&quot;

&quot;All this she must possess,&quot; added Darcy, &quot;and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading.&quot;

&quot;I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.&quot;

&quot;Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?&quot;

&quot;_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.&quot;

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

&quot;Eliza Bennet,&quot; said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, &quot;is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.&quot;

&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
&quot;there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.&quot;

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones&#39;s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother&#39;s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.




CHAPTER IX.


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister&#39;s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen therefore to her daughter&#39;s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley&#39;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

&quot;Indeed I have, Sir,&quot; was her answer. &quot;She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.&quot;

&quot;Removed!&quot; cried Bingley. &quot;It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.&quot;

&quot;You may depend upon it, Madam,&quot; said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
&quot;that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

&quot;I am sure,&quot; she added, &quot;if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I
hope, though you have but a short lease.&quot;

&quot;Whatever I do is done in a hurry,&quot; replied he; &quot;and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.&quot;

&quot;That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,&quot; said Elizabeth.

&quot;You begin to comprehend me, do you?&quot; cried he, turning towards her.

&quot;Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.&quot;

&quot;I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.&quot;

&quot;That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.&quot;

&quot;Lizzy,&quot; cried her mother, &quot;remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.&quot;

&quot;I did not know before,&quot; continued Bingley immediately, &quot;that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.&quot;

&quot;Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.&quot;

&quot;The country,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society.&quot;

&quot;But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.&quot;

&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. &quot;I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.&quot;

Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

&quot;I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?&quot;

&quot;When I am in the country,&quot; he replied, &quot;I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.&quot;

&quot;Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,&quot; looking at Darcy, &quot;seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.&quot;

&quot;Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,&quot; said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. &quot;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.&quot;

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother&#39;s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

&quot;Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every
body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter.&quot;

&quot;Did Charlotte dine with you?&quot;

&quot;No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.&quot;

&quot;She seems a very pleasant young woman,&quot; said Bingley.

&quot;Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane&#39;s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body
better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner&#39;s in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
But however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.&quot;

&quot;And so ended his affection,&quot; said Elizabeth impatiently. &quot;There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!&quot;

&quot;I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,&quot; said Darcy.

&quot;Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&quot;

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle&#39;s good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother&#39;s ear.

&quot;I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.&quot;

Lydia declared herself satisfied. &quot;Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,&quot; she
added, &quot;I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations&#39; behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley&#39;s witticisms on _fine eyes_.




CHAPTER X.


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

&quot;How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!&quot;

He made no answer.

&quot;You write uncommonly fast.&quot;

&quot;You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.&quot;

&quot;How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!&quot;

&quot;It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.&quot;

&quot;Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.&quot;

&quot;I have already told her so once, by your desire.&quot;

&quot;I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.&quot;

&quot;Thank you--but I always mend my own.&quot;

&quot;How can you contrive to write so even?&quot;

He was silent.

&quot;Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
present I have not room to do them justice.&quot;

&quot;Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?&quot;

&quot;They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.&quot;

&quot;It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill.&quot;

&quot;That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,&quot; cried her
brother--&quot;because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?&quot;

&quot;My style of writing is very different from yours.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Miss Bingley, &quot;Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.&quot;

&quot;My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.&quot;

&quot;Your humility, Mr. Bingley,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;must disarm reproof.&quot;

&quot;Nothing is more deceitful,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.&quot;

&quot;And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?&quot;

&quot;The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?&quot;

&quot;Nay,&quot; cried Bingley, &quot;this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.&quot;

&quot;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &#39;Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,&#39; you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.&quot;

&quot;You have only proved by this,&quot; cried Elizabeth, &quot;that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself.&quot;

&quot;I am exceedingly gratified,&quot; said Bingley, &quot;by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.&quot;

&quot;Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?&quot;

&quot;Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
himself.&quot;

&quot;You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety.&quot;

&quot;To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.&quot;

&quot;To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.&quot;

&quot;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?&quot;

&quot;Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?&quot;

&quot;By all means,&quot; cried Bingley; &quot;let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
when he has nothing to do.&quot;

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

&quot;I see your design, Bingley,&quot; said his friend.--&quot;You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.&quot;

&quot;What you ask,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.&quot;

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy&#39;s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her--

&quot;Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?&quot;

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

&quot;Oh!&quot; said she, &quot;I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &#39;Yes,&#39;
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I do not dare.&quot;

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

&quot;I hope,&quot; said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, &quot;you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.&quot;

&quot;Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?&quot;

&quot;Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle
the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth&#39;s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?&quot;

&quot;It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.&quot;

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

&quot;I did not know that you intended to walk,&quot; said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

&quot;You used us abominably ill,&quot; answered Mrs. Hurst, &quot;in running away
without telling us that you were coming out.&quot;

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

&quot;This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.&quot;

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

&quot;No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group&#39;d, and appear to
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good bye.&quot;

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.




CHAPTER XI.


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.
Miss Bingley&#39;s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was &quot;very glad;&quot; but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley&#39;s salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother&#39;s conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley&#39;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy&#39;s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &quot;How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.&quot;

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

&quot;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.&quot;

&quot;If you mean Darcy,&quot; cried her brother, &quot;he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my
cards.&quot;

&quot;I should like balls infinitely better,&quot; she replied, &quot;if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.&quot;

&quot;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball.&quot;

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
Elizabeth, said,

&quot;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude.&quot;

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere. &quot;What could he mean? she was dying to know what could
be his meaning&quot;--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?

&quot;Not at all,&quot; was her answer; &quot;but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it.&quot;

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.

&quot;I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&quot; said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. &quot;You either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other&#39;s confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.&quot;

&quot;Oh! shocking!&quot; cried Miss Bingley. &quot;I never heard any thing so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?&quot;

&quot;Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;We
can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at
him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.&quot;

&quot;But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.
Darcy may hug himself.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!&quot; cried Elizabeth. &quot;That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
laugh.&quot;

&quot;Miss Bingley,&quot; said he, &quot;has given me credit for more than can be. The
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Elizabeth--&quot;there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.&quot;

&quot;Such as vanity and pride.&quot;

&quot;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.&quot;

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

&quot;Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,&quot; said Miss
Bingley;--&quot;and pray what is the result?&quot;

&quot;I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.&quot;

&quot;No&quot;--said Darcy, &quot;I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost
for ever.&quot;

&quot;_That_ is a failing indeed!&quot;--cried Elizabeth. &quot;Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.&quot;

&quot;There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.&quot;

&quot;And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.&quot;

&quot;And yours,&quot; he replied with a smile, &quot;is wilfully to misunderstand
them.&quot;

&quot;Do let us have a little music,&quot;--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--&quot;Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst.&quot;

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.




CHAPTER XII.


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane&#39;s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth&#39;s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley&#39;s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley&#39;s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had
information for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.




CHAPTER XIII.


&quot;I hope, my dear,&quot; said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, &quot;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&quot;

&quot;Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.&quot;

&quot;The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger.&quot; Mrs.
Bennet&#39;s eyes sparkled.--&quot;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley
I am sure. Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!
Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good
lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia,
my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment.&quot;

&quot;It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,&quot; said her husband; &quot;it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.&quot;

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.
&quot;About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.&quot;

&quot;Oh! my dear,&quot; cried his wife, &quot;I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.&quot;

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

&quot;It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,&quot; said Mr. Bennet, &quot;and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.&quot;

&quot;No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?&quot;

&quot;Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.&quot;

     _Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

     15th October._

     DEAR SIR,

     The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--&quot;There, Mrs. Bennet.&quot;--My mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o&#39;clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
     se&#39;night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     WILLIAM COLLINS.&quot;

&quot;At four o&#39;clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,&quot;
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. &quot;He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.&quot;

&quot;There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.&quot;

&quot;Though it is difficult,&quot; said Jane, &quot;to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.&quot;

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

&quot;He must be an oddity, I think,&quot; said she. &quot;I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?&quot;

&quot;No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.&quot;

&quot;In point of composition,&quot; said Mary, &quot;his letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.&quot;

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins&#39;s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

&quot;You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.&quot;

&quot;You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.&quot;

&quot;Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.&quot;

&quot;I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----&quot;

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins&#39;s admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet&#39;s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged
pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.




CHAPTER XIV.


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh&#39;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.

&quot;That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, &quot;and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?&quot;

&quot;The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship&#39;s residence.&quot;

&quot;I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?&quot;

&quot;She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot; cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, &quot;then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?&quot;

&quot;She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&quot;

&quot;Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.&quot;

&quot;Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.&quot;

&quot;You judge very properly,&quot; said Mr. Bennet, &quot;and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?&quot;

&quot;They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.&quot;

Mr. Bennet&#39;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.

By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce&#39;s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

&quot;Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,
and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.&quot;

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

&quot;I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.&quot;

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia&#39;s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.




CHAPTER XV.


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father&#39;s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet&#39;s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour&#39;s tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--&quot;As to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.&quot;

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.

Lydia&#39;s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger&#39;s air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.

In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Philips&#39;s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia&#39;s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips&#39; throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones&#39;s shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane&#39;s introduction of him. She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant&#39;s
commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham
appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become &quot;stupid,
disagreeable fellows.&quot; Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips&#39;s manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.




CHAPTER XVI.


As no objection was made to the young people&#39;s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins&#39;s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle&#39;s invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine&#39;s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper&#39;s room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last however. The
gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.

When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.

&quot;I know little of the game, at present,&quot; said he, &quot;but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----&quot; Mrs. Philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia&#39;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

&quot;About a month,&quot; said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, &quot;He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Wickham;--&quot;his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.&quot;

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

&quot;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&quot;

&quot;As much as I ever wish to be,&quot; cried Elizabeth warmly,--&quot;I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.&quot;

&quot;I have no right to give _my_ opinion,&quot; said Wickham, &quot;as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.&quot;

&quot;Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one.&quot;

&quot;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&quot; said Wickham, after a short
interruption, &quot;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.&quot;

&quot;I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.&quot; Wickham only shook his head.

&quot;I wonder,&quot; said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, &quot;whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.&quot;

&quot;I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.&quot;

&quot;Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father.&quot;

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

&quot;It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,&quot; he added,
&quot;which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.&quot;

&quot;Indeed!&quot;

&quot;Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.&quot;

&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Elizabeth; &quot;but how could _that_ be?--How could
his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?&quot;

&quot;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.&quot;

&quot;This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced.&quot;

&quot;Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.&quot;

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

&quot;But what,&quot; said she, after a pause, &quot;can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?&quot;

&quot;A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father&#39;s uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me.&quot;

&quot;I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!&quot;

After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, &quot;I _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must
be dreadful.&quot;

&quot;I will not trust myself on the subject,&quot; replied Wickham, &quot;_I_ can
hardly be just to him.&quot;

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, &quot;To
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!&quot;--She could have added, &quot;A young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable&quot;--but she contented
herself with &quot;And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner!&quot;

&quot;We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father&#39;s active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father&#39;s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.&quot;

&quot;How strange!&quot; cried Elizabeth. &quot;How abominable!--I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it.&quot;

&quot;It _is_ wonderful,&quot;--replied Wickham,--&quot;for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride.&quot;

&quot;Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers.&quot;

&quot;What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?&quot;

He shook his head.--&quot;I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her
father&#39;s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education.&quot;

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

&quot;I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you
know Mr. Bingley?&quot;

&quot;Not at all.&quot;

&quot;He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.&quot;

&quot;Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.&quot;

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.

&quot;I know very well, madam,&quot; said he, &quot;that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.&quot;

Mr. Wickham&#39;s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

&quot;Lady Catherine de Bourgh,&quot; she replied, &quot;has very lately given him a
living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.&quot;

&quot;You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.&quot;

&quot;No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&#39;s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.&quot;

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.

&quot;Mr. Collins,&quot; said she, &quot;speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.&quot;

&quot;I believe her to be both in a great degree,&quot; replied Wickham; &quot;I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.&quot;

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham&#39;s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips&#39;s supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.




CHAPTER XVII.


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley&#39;s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

&quot;They have both,&quot; said she, &quot;been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.&quot;

&quot;Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.&quot;

&quot;Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&#39;s favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? oh! no.&quot;

&quot;I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley&#39;s being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks.&quot;

&quot;It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to
think.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.&quot;

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet&#39;s civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy&#39;s
looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.
Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.

&quot;While I can have my mornings to myself,&quot; said she, &quot;it is enough.--I
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body.&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley&#39;s invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening&#39;s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

&quot;I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,&quot; said he, &quot;that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.&quot;

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help
for it however. Mr. Wickham&#39;s happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins&#39;s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.




CHAPTER XVIII.


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&#39;s
pleasure in the Bingleys&#39; invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

&quot;I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.&quot;

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham&#39;s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her.

&quot;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&quot;

&quot;Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
such an evil.&quot;

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours&#39; looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

&quot;It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples.&quot;

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

&quot;Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--But _now_ we may be silent.&quot;

&quot;Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.&quot;

&quot;Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?&quot;

&quot;Both,&quot; replied Elizabeth archly; &quot;for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.&quot;

&quot;This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,&quot;
said he. &quot;How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.&quot;

&quot;I must not decide on my own performance.&quot;

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, &quot;When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.&quot;

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

&quot;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain.&quot;

&quot;He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,&quot; replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, &quot;and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.&quot;

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.

&quot;I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&quot;

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William&#39;s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

&quot;Sir William&#39;s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.&quot;

&quot;I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.&quot;

&quot;What think you of books?&quot; said he, smiling.

&quot;Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.&quot;

&quot;No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.&quot;

&quot;The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?&quot; said he,
with a look of doubt.

&quot;Yes, always,&quot; she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, &quot;I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; said he, with a firm voice.

&quot;And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?&quot;

&quot;I hope not.&quot;

&quot;It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.&quot;

&quot;May I ask to what these questions tend?&quot;

&quot;Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,&quot; said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. &quot;I am trying to make it out.&quot;

&quot;And what is your success?&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.&quot;

&quot;I can readily believe,&quot; answered he gravely, &quot;that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.&quot;

&quot;But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.&quot;

&quot;I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,&quot; he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in Darcy&#39;s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

&quot;So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
late Mr. Darcy&#39;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.
Darcy&#39;s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite&#39;s guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.&quot;

&quot;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&quot; said
Elizabeth angrily; &quot;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy&#39;s steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
&quot;Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.&quot;

&quot;Insolent girl!&quot; said Elizabeth to herself.--&quot;You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.&quot; She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of Jane&#39;s being in the fairest way for
happiness.

&quot;I want to know,&quot; said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister&#39;s, &quot;what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; replied Jane, &quot;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister&#39;s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&#39;s
regard.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?&quot;

&quot;No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.&quot;

&quot;This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?&quot;

&quot;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.&quot;

&quot;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&#39;s sincerity,&quot; said Elizabeth warmly;
&quot;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley&#39;s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before.&quot;

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley&#39;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.

&quot;I have found out,&quot; said he, &quot;by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.&quot;

&quot;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine&#39;s _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&#39;night.&quot;

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

&quot;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself.&quot; And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words &quot;apology,&quot;
&quot;Hunsford,&quot; and &quot;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&quot;--It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&#39;s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

&quot;I have no reason, I assure you,&quot; said he, &quot;to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&#39;s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&quot;

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley&#39;s two sisters. Her mother&#39;s thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane&#39;s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&#39;s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

&quot;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.&quot;

&quot;For heaven&#39;s sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.&quot;

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
Elizabeth&#39;s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another. Mary&#39;s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

&quot;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&quot;

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father&#39;s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.

&quot;If I,&quot; said Mr. Collins, &quot;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family.&quot; And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&#39;s conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy&#39;s farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of &quot;Lord,
how tired I am!&quot; accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.




CHAPTER XIX.


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

&quot;May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?&quot;

Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,

&quot;Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am
sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.&quot; And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,

&quot;Dear Ma&#39;am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse
me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am
going away myself.&quot;

&quot;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are.&quot;--And
upon Elizabeth&#39;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, &quot;Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr. Collins.&quot;

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment&#39;s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.

&quot;Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother&#39;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did.&quot;

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

&quot;My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh&#39;s foot-stool, that she said, &#39;Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&#39; Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother&#39;s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.&quot;

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

&quot;You are too hasty, Sir,&quot; she cried. &quot;You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them.&quot;

&quot;I am not now to learn,&quot; replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, &quot;that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.&quot;

&quot;Upon my word, Sir,&quot; cried Elizabeth, &quot;your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.&quot;

&quot;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&quot; said Mr. Collins
very gravely--&quot;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications.&quot;

&quot;Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled.&quot; And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus
addressed her,

&quot;When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.&quot;

&quot;Really, Mr. Collins,&quot; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &quot;you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one.&quot;

&quot;You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.&quot;

&quot;I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart.&quot;

&quot;You are uniformly charming!&quot; cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; &quot;and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.&quot;

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.




CHAPTER XX.


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.

&quot;But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,&quot; she added, &quot;that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it.&quot;

&quot;Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,&quot; cried Mr. Collins; &quot;but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.&quot;

&quot;Sir, you quite misunderstand me,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. &quot;Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.&quot;

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

&quot;Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_.&quot;

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

&quot;I have not the pleasure of understanding you,&quot; said he, when she had
finished her speech. &quot;Of what are you talking?&quot;

&quot;Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.&quot;

&quot;And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business.&quot;

&quot;Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.&quot;

&quot;Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

&quot;Come here, child,&quot; cried her father as she appeared. &quot;I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?&quot; Elizabeth replied that it was.
&quot;Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?&quot;

&quot;I have, Sir.&quot;

&quot;Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?&quot;

&quot;Yes, or I will never see her again.&quot;

&quot;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.&quot;

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

&quot;What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him.&quot;

&quot;My dear,&quot; replied her husband, &quot;I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.&quot;

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother&#39;s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, &quot;I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.&quot;

Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. &quot;Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,&quot; she added in a melancholy tone,
&quot;for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.&quot;

Charlotte&#39;s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

&quot;Aye, there she comes,&quot; continued Mrs. Bennet, &quot;looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I
told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I
suffer!--But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
pitied.&quot;

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

&quot;Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.&quot;

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--&quot;Oh! Mr. Collins!&quot;--

&quot;My dear Madam,&quot; replied he, &quot;let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,&quot; he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, &quot;to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I
trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter&#39;s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter&#39;s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to
error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.&quot;




CHAPTER XXI.


The discussion of Mr. Collins&#39;s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&#39;s ill humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt&#39;s, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.

&quot;I found,&quot; said he, &quot;as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.&quot;

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady&#39;s
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister&#39;s countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they
had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,

&quot;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.
You shall hear what she says.&quot;

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. &quot;I do not pretend to
regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.&quot; To these high
flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley&#39;s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

&quot;It is unlucky,&quot; said she, after a short pause, &quot;that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.&quot;

&quot;Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--

&quot;When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you.&quot;

&quot;It is evident by this,&quot; added Jane, &quot;that he comes back no more this
winter.&quot;

&quot;It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.&quot;

&quot;Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.&quot; &quot;Mr. Darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana
Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister&#39;s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman&#39;s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?&quot;

&quot;What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?&quot;--said Jane as she
finished it. &quot;Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother&#39;s indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&quot;

&quot;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?&quot;

&quot;Most willingly.&quot;

&quot;You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.&quot;

Jane shook her head.

&quot;Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is
not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is
this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&quot;

&quot;If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,&quot; replied Jane, &quot;your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself.&quot;

&quot;That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.&quot;

&quot;But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?&quot;

&quot;You must decide for yourself,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him.&quot;

&quot;How can you talk so?&quot;--said Jane faintly smiling,--&quot;You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.&quot;

&quot;I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.&quot;

&quot;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!&quot;

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline&#39;s
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane&#39;s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman&#39;s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.




CHAPTER XXII.


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &quot;It keeps him in good
humour,&quot; said she, &quot;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&quot;
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte&#39;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins&#39;s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas&#39;s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins&#39;s long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins&#39;s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James&#39;s. The whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&#39;s
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.

&quot;My dear Madam,&quot; he replied, &quot;this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.&quot;

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

&quot;But is there not danger of Lady Catherine&#39;s disapprobation here, my
good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness.&quot;

&quot;My dear sir,&quot; replied Mr. Collins, &quot;I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship&#39;s concurrence.&quot;

&quot;You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.&quot;

&quot;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth.&quot;

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her&#39;s, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins&#39;s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

&quot;Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!&quot;

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

&quot;Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&#39;s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&quot;

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.

&quot;I see what you are feeling,&quot; replied Charlotte,--&quot;you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to
marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I
never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&#39;s
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.&quot;

Elizabeth quietly answered &quot;Undoubtedly;&quot;--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&#39;s making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte&#39;s opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.




CHAPTER XXIII.


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

&quot;Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&quot;

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William&#39;s good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet&#39;s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet&#39;s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth&#39;s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins&#39;s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley&#39;s continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane&#39;s happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth&#39;s; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all
Jane&#39;s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

&quot;Indeed, Mr. Bennet,&quot; said she, &quot;it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!&quot;

&quot;My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.&quot;

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

&quot;I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it.&quot;

&quot;What should not you mind?&quot;

&quot;I should not mind any thing at all.&quot;

&quot;Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.&quot;

&quot;I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one&#39;s own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.
Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?&quot;

&quot;I leave it to yourself to determine,&quot; said Mr. Bennet.

PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


Miss Bingley&#39;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother&#39;s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&#39;s praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&#39;s being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy&#39;s house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline&#39;s
assertion of her brother&#39;s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister&#39;s was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley&#39;s regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends&#39; interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane&#39;s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister&#39;s situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet&#39;s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

&quot;Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I
will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.&quot;

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

&quot;You doubt me,&quot; cried Jane, slightly colouring; &quot;indeed you have no
reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better.&quot;

With a stronger voice she soon added, &quot;I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself.&quot;

&quot;My dear Jane!&quot; exclaimed Elizabeth, &quot;you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.&quot;

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister&#39;s warm affection.

&quot;Nay,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. _I_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;
the other is Charlotte&#39;s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!&quot;

&quot;My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins&#39;s respectability, and
Charlotte&#39;s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body&#39;s sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin.&quot;

&quot;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her,
though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness.&quot;

&quot;I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,&quot; replied
Jane, &quot;and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.&quot;

&quot;And men take care that they should.&quot;

&quot;If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.&quot;

&quot;I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&#39;s conduct to design,&quot;
said Elizabeth; &quot;but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people&#39;s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.&quot;

&quot;And do you impute it to either of those?&quot;

&quot;Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.&quot;

&quot;You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.&quot;

&quot;Yes, in conjunction with his friend.&quot;

&quot;I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.&quot;

&quot;Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.&quot;

&quot;Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,&quot; replied Jane;
&quot;but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother&#39;s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.&quot;

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley&#39;s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet&#39;s best
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. &quot;So, Lizzy,&quot; said he one day,
&quot;your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be
long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane&#39;s good fortune.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; said Mr. Bennet, &quot;but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it.&quot;

Mr. Wickham&#39;s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.




CHAPTER II.


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than
Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

&quot;I do not blame Jane,&quot; she continued, &quot;for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins&#39;s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.&quot;

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth&#39;s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. &quot;It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,&quot; said she. &quot;I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.&quot;

&quot;An excellent consolation in its way,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.&quot;

&quot;But that expression of &#39;violently in love&#39; is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour&#39;s acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley&#39;s
love?&quot;

&quot;I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything.&quot;

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister&#39;s ready acquiescence.

&quot;I hope,&quot; added Mrs. Gardiner, &quot;that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.&quot;

&quot;And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would
hardly think a month&#39;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.&quot;

&quot;So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.&quot;

&quot;She will drop the acquaintance entirely.&quot;

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley&#39;s being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&#39;s
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt&#39;s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by Caroline&#39;s not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&#39;s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire, to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy&#39;s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy&#39;s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman&#39;s reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.




CHAPTER III.


Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

&quot;You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.&quot;

&quot;My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&quot;

&quot;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.&quot;

&quot;Elizabeth, you are not serious now.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father&#39;s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him.&quot;

&quot;As I did the other day,&quot; said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; &quot;very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&#39;s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you
are satisfied.&quot;

Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she &quot;_wished_ they might be happy.&quot; Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother&#39;s ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,

&quot;I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.&quot;

&quot;_That_ you certainly shall.&quot;

&quot;And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?&quot;

&quot;We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.&quot;

&quot;I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.&quot;

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

&quot;My father and Maria are to come to me in March,&quot; added Charlotte, &quot;and
I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them.&quot;

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte&#39;s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine&#39;s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins&#39;s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.

&quot;My aunt,&quot; she continued, &quot;is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street.&quot;

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
&quot;I did not think Caroline in spirits,&quot; were her words, &quot;but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
soon see them here.&quot;

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister&#39;s being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley&#39;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.

     &quot;My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley&#39;s regard for me. But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot
     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear
     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.

     &quot;Your&#39;s, &amp;c.&quot;

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy&#39;s sister, as, by Wickham&#39;s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in Charlotte&#39;s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--&quot;I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain.&quot;




CHAPTER IV.


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte&#39;s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known Sir William&#39;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&#39;s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin&#39;s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley&#39;s visit in Gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham&#39;s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

&quot;But, my dear Elizabeth,&quot; she added, &quot;what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.&quot;

&quot;Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.&quot;

&quot;If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.&quot;

&quot;She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.&quot;

&quot;But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather&#39;s
death made her mistress of this fortune.&quot;

&quot;No--why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?&quot;

&quot;But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event.&quot;

&quot;A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?&quot;

&quot;_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_. It only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; cried Elizabeth, &quot;have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.&quot;

&quot;No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.&quot;

&quot;Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.&quot;

&quot;Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.&quot;

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

&quot;We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,&quot; said Mrs.
Gardiner, &quot;but perhaps to the Lakes.&quot;

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. &quot;My dear, dear
aunt,&quot; she rapturously cried, &quot;what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men
to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.&quot;




CHAPTER V.


Every object in the next day&#39;s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
cousin&#39;s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife&#39;s offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr.
Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband&#39;s
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte&#39;s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed,

&quot;Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home. Her ladyship&#39;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship&#39;s carriages, for she has several.&quot;

&quot;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&quot; added
Charlotte, &quot;and a most attentive neighbour.&quot;

&quot;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&quot;

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
Charlotte&#39;s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the
door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

&quot;Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.&quot;

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

&quot;And is this all?&quot; cried Elizabeth. &quot;I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!&quot;

&quot;La! my dear,&quot; said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, &quot;it is not Lady
Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The
other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!&quot;

&quot;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?&quot;

&quot;Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in.&quot;

&quot;I like her appearance,&quot; said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. &quot;She
looks sickly and cross.--Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife.&quot;

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth&#39;s high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh
looked that way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.




CHAPTER VI.


Mr. Collins&#39;s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine&#39;s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

&quot;I confess,&quot; said he, &quot;that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship&#39;s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!&quot;

&quot;I am the less surprised at what has happened,&quot; replied Sir William,
&quot;from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.&quot;

Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

&quot;Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.&quot;

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at St. James&#39;s.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&#39;s alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.--Elizabeth&#39;s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her&#39;s, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James&#39;s, Sir William was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth&#39;s mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria&#39;s astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship&#39;s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte&#39;s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her&#39;s, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady&#39;s attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother&#39;s maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then
observed,

&quot;Your father&#39;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,&quot; turning to Charlotte, &quot;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh&#39;s family.--Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?&quot;

&quot;A little.&quot;

&quot;Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?&quot;

&quot;One of them does.&quot;

&quot;Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your&#39;s.--Do you draw?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all.&quot;

&quot;What, none of you?&quot;

&quot;Not one.&quot;

&quot;That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.&quot;

&quot;My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.&quot;

&quot;Has your governess left you?&quot;

&quot;We never had any governess.&quot;

&quot;No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.&quot;

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.

&quot;Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must
have been neglected.&quot;

&quot;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might.&quot;

&quot;Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe&#39;s
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &#39;Lady
Catherine,&#39; said she, &#39;you have given me a treasure.&#39; Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am, all.&quot;

&quot;All!--What, all five out at once? Very odd!--And you only the
second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your
younger sisters must be very young?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company. But really, Ma&#39;am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind.&quot;

&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said her Ladyship, &quot;you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?&quot;

&quot;With three younger sisters grown up,&quot; replied Elizabeth smiling, &quot;your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.&quot;

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

&quot;You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age.&quot;

&quot;I am not one and twenty.&quot;

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh&#39;s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins&#39;s side, and as many bows on Sir William&#39;s, they departed. As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte&#39;s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship&#39;s
praise into his own hands.




CHAPTER VII.


Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter&#39;s being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes&#39; conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins&#39;s joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses&#39; reach. This
however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine&#39;s curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley&#39;s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband&#39;s room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

&quot;I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.&quot;

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment&#39;s pause, added,

&quot;My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?&quot;

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.




CHAPTER VIII.


Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen&#39;s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
only seen at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine&#39;s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins&#39;s pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

&quot;What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.&quot;

&quot;We are speaking of music, Madam,&quot; said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

&quot;Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I
should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?&quot;

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister&#39;s proficiency.

&quot;I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,&quot; said Lady
Catherine; &quot;and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal.&quot;

&quot;I assure you, Madam,&quot; he replied, &quot;that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.&quot;

&quot;So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often
told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
Mrs. Jenkinson&#39;s room. She would be in nobody&#39;s way, you know, in that
part of the house.&quot;

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt&#39;s ill breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&#39;s
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

&quot;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me.&quot;

&quot;I shall not say that you are mistaken,&quot; he replied, &quot;because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own.&quot;

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, &quot;Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.&quot;

&quot;I am not afraid of you,&quot; said he, smilingly.

&quot;Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,&quot; cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. &quot;I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.&quot;

&quot;You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was. He danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr.
Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.&quot;

&quot;I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.&quot;

&quot;True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.&quot;

&quot;Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?&quot; said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. &quot;Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?&quot;

&quot;I can answer your question,&quot; said Fitzwilliam, &quot;without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&quot;

&quot;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&quot; said Darcy,
&quot;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.&quot;

&quot;My fingers,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women&#39;s do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman&#39;s of superior execution.&quot;

Darcy smiled and said, &quot;You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.&quot;

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,

&quot;Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne&#39;s. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.&quot;

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin&#39;s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth&#39;s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship&#39;s carriage was
ready to take them all home.




CHAPTER IX.


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

&quot;How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.&quot;

&quot;Perfectly so--I thank you.&quot;

She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

&quot;I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?&quot;

&quot;I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.&quot;

&quot;If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle.&quot;

&quot;I should not be surprised,&quot; said Darcy, &quot;if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.&quot;

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, &quot;This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.&quot;

&quot;I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&quot;

&quot;Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.&quot;

&quot;It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.&quot;

&quot;An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.&quot;

&quot;And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day&#39;s
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.&quot;

&quot;I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,&quot; cried Elizabeth. &quot;I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.&quot;

&quot;It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.&quot;

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

&quot;I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.&quot;

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, &quot;_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.&quot;

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

&quot;Are you pleased with Kent?&quot;

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.

&quot;What can be the meaning of this!&quot; said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. &quot;My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way.&quot;

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte&#39;s wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam&#39;s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend&#39;s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.




CHAPTER X.


More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly
meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.
and Mrs. Collins&#39;s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words
seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane&#39;s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,
she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

&quot;I did not know before that you ever walked this way.&quot;

&quot;I have been making the tour of the Park,&quot; he replied, &quot;as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?&quot;

&quot;No, I should have turned in a moment.&quot;

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

&quot;Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?&quot; said she.

&quot;Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.&quot;

&quot;And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.&quot;

&quot;He likes to have his own way very well,&quot; replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
&quot;But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.&quot;

&quot;In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of
either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?&quot;

&quot;These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry
where they like.&quot;

&quot;Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.&quot;

&quot;Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.&quot;

&quot;Is this,&quot; thought Elizabeth, &quot;meant for me?&quot; and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, &quot;And pray, what is
the usual price of an Earl&#39;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.&quot;

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

&quot;I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Colonel Fitzwilliam, &quot;that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.&quot;

&quot;Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.&quot;

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,

&quot;You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.&quot;

&quot;I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of Darcy&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; said Elizabeth drily--&quot;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&quot;

&quot;Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.&quot;

&quot;What is it you mean?&quot;

&quot;It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady&#39;s family,
it would be an unpleasant thing.&quot;

&quot;You may depend upon my not mentioning it.&quot;

&quot;And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.&quot;

&quot;Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?&quot;

&quot;I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.&quot;

&quot;And what arts did he use to separate them?&quot;

&quot;He did not talk to me of his own arts,&quot; said Fitzwilliam smiling. &quot;He
only told me, what I have now told you.&quot;

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

&quot;I am thinking of what you have been telling me,&quot; said she. &quot;Your
cousin&#39;s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?&quot;

&quot;You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?&quot;

&quot;I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend&#39;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.&quot; &quot;But,&quot;
she continued, recollecting herself, &quot;as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.&quot;

&quot;That is not an unnatural surmise,&quot; said Fitzwilliam, &quot;but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin&#39;s triumph very sadly.&quot;

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.

&quot;There were some very strong objections against the lady,&quot; were Colonel
Fitzwilliam&#39;s words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

&quot;To Jane herself,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;there could be no possibility of
objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach.&quot; When she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend&#39;s connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&#39;s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.




CHAPTER XI.


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&#39;s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister&#39;s sufferings. It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy&#39;s leaving Kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

&quot;In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man&#39;s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

&quot;In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of
short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation.&quot;

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth&#39;s feelings
dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

&quot;And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.&quot;

&quot;I might as well enquire,&quot; replied she, &quot;why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?&quot;

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.

&quot;I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.&quot;

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

&quot;Can you deny that you have done it?&quot; she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied, &quot;I have no wish of denying
that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.&quot;

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

&quot;But it is not merely this affair,&quot; she continued, &quot;on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?&quot;

&quot;You take an eager interest in that gentleman&#39;s concerns,&quot; said Darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

&quot;Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?&quot;

&quot;His misfortunes!&quot; repeated Darcy contemptuously; &quot;yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed.&quot;

&quot;And of your infliction,&quot; cried Elizabeth with energy. &quot;You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule.&quot;

&quot;And this,&quot; cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
&quot;is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,&quot; added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, &quot;these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?&quot;

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

&quot;You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.&quot;

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

&quot;You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.&quot;

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.

&quot;From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.&quot;

&quot;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.&quot;

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for
so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend&#39;s marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine&#39;s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte&#39;s observation, and hurried her away to her room.




CHAPTER XII.


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy&#39;s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, &quot;I
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?&quot;--And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise
full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o&#39;clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     &quot;Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
     You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
     demand it of your justice.

     &quot;Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached
     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.
     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your&#39;s, I can only say that I am sorry.--The
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I
     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the
     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that
     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made
     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas&#39;s accidental information, that
     Bingley&#39;s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I
     observed my friend&#39;s behaviour attentively; and I could then
     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had
     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the
     evening&#39;s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have
     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister&#39;s countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be
     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother&#39;s
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His
     sisters&#39; uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly
     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister&#39;s indifference. He had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against
     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister&#39;s being in town. I knew it myself, as
     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister&#39;s
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman&#39;s education. My father was not
     only fond of this young man&#39;s society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think
     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.
     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.
     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he
     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other
     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
     father&#39;s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I
     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no
     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother&#39;s nephew, Colonel
     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;
     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt
     and how I acted. Regard for my sister&#39;s credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from
     her charge. Mr. Wickham&#39;s chief object was unquestionably my
     sister&#39;s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.
     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father&#39;s will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.

     &quot;FITZWILLIAM DARCY.&quot;




CHAPTER XIII.


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister&#39;s
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It
was all pride and insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, &quot;This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!&quot;--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham&#39;s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render Mr. Darcy&#39;s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr. Wickham&#39;s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no
such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin&#39;s affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin&#39;s corroboration.

She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips&#39;s.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.
Darcy&#39;s character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had
his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

&quot;How despicably have I acted!&quot; she cried.--&quot;I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this
discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.&quot;

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy&#39;s explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister&#39;s attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what Charlotte&#39;s opinion had always been.--Neither could she
deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane&#39;s
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
Jane&#39;s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object. She could think only of her letter.




CHAPTER XIV.


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship&#39;s indignation would have been. &quot;What would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?&quot; were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--&quot;I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,&quot; said Lady Catherine; &quot;I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His
attachment to Rosings, certainly increases.&quot;

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

&quot;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.&quot;

&quot;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&quot; replied
Elizabeth, &quot;but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town
next Saturday.&quot;

&quot;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.&quot;

&quot;But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return.&quot;

&quot;Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&quot;

&quot;You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.&quot;

Lady Catherine seemed resigned.

&quot;Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always
speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send
somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady
Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I
am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.&quot;

&quot;My uncle is to send a servant for us.&quot;

&quot;Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change
horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,
you will be attended to.&quot;

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother&#39;s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia&#39;s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.

Anxiety on Jane&#39;s behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr.
Darcy&#39;s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!

When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham&#39;s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.




CHAPTER XV.


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

&quot;I know not, Miss Elizabeth,&quot; said he, &quot;whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.&quot;

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

&quot;It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine&#39;s family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on
what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In
truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.&quot;

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

&quot;You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine&#39;s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.&quot;

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.

&quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.&quot;

Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, &quot;it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!&quot;

&quot;A great many indeed,&quot; said her companion with a sigh.

&quot;We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--How much I shall have to tell!&quot;

Elizabeth privately added, &quot;And how much I shall have to conceal.&quot;

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner&#39;s
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy&#39;s proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.




CHAPTER XVI.


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet&#39;s carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman&#39;s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
&quot;Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?&quot;

&quot;And we mean to treat you all,&quot; added Lydia; &quot;but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.&quot; Then shewing
her purchases: &quot;Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.&quot;

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, &quot;Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.&quot;

&quot;Are they indeed?&quot; cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

&quot;They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; thought Elizabeth, &quot;_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.&quot;

&quot;Now I have got some news for you,&quot; said Lydia, as they sat down to
table. &quot;What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.&quot;

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,

&quot;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
There is no danger of Wickham&#39;s marrying Mary King. There&#39;s for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&quot;

&quot;And Mary King is safe!&quot; added Elizabeth; &quot;safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.&quot;

&quot;She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.&quot;

&quot;But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,&quot; said Jane.

&quot;I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?&quot;

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty&#39;s and
Lydia&#39;s purchases, were seated in it.

&quot;How nicely we are crammed in!&quot; cried Lydia. &quot;I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can&#39;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster&#39;s. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman&#39;s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.&quot;

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty&#39;s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham&#39;s name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,

&quot;I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.&quot;

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person&#39;s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.

&quot;Oh! Mary,&quot; said she, &quot;I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought
we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!&quot;

To this, Mary very gravely replied, &quot;Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms
for _me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.&quot;

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was
another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_,
of the regiment&#39;s approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.




CHAPTER XVII.


Elizabeth&#39;s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet&#39;s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister&#39;s refusal must have given him.

&quot;His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,&quot; said she; &quot;and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?&quot;

&quot;Blame you! Oh, no.&quot;

&quot;But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.&quot;

&quot;No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.&quot;

&quot;But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day.&quot;

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy&#39;s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.

&quot;This will not do,&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;You never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy&#39;s, but you shall do as you chuse.&quot;

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

&quot;I do not know when I have been more shocked,&quot; said she. &quot;Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of
his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so.&quot;

&quot;Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.&quot;

&quot;Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.&quot;

&quot;There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.&quot;

&quot;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.&quot;

&quot;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&#39;s genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&quot;

&quot;Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very
uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!&quot;

&quot;How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.&quot;

&quot;Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is
one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham&#39;s character.&quot;

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, &quot;Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?&quot;

&quot;That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public. On the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will
say nothing about it.&quot;

&quot;You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.&quot;

The tumult of Elizabeth&#39;s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery. &quot;And then,&quot; said she, &quot;if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!&quot;

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister&#39;s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.

&quot;Well, Lizzy,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet one day, &quot;what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane&#39;s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I
cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London. Well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was
her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done.&quot;

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

&quot;Well, Lizzy,&quot; continued her mother soon afterwards, &quot;and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing at all.&quot;

&quot;A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it
quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&quot;

&quot;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&quot;

&quot;No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&quot;




CHAPTER XVIII.


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment&#39;s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

&quot;Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!&quot; would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. &quot;How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?&quot;

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.

&quot;I am sure,&quot; said she, &quot;I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millar&#39;s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.&quot;

&quot;I am sure I shall break _mine_,&quot; said Lydia.

&quot;If one could but go to Brighton!&quot; observed Mrs. Bennet.

&quot;Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable.&quot;

&quot;A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.&quot;

&quot;And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,&quot;
added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy&#39;s
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia&#39;s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months&#39; acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&#39;s feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one&#39;s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

&quot;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,&quot;
said she, &quot;though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.&quot;

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia&#39;s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,

&quot;Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.&quot;

&quot;If you were aware,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&#39;s unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.&quot;

&quot;Already arisen!&quot; repeated Mr. Bennet. &quot;What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by Lydia&#39;s folly.&quot;

&quot;Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia&#39;s character. Excuse me--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?&quot;

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

&quot;Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.&quot;

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia&#39;s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same. Lydia&#39;s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband&#39;s never intending to go there
himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia&#39;s leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment&#39;s remaining in Meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam&#39;s and Mr. Darcy&#39;s having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment&#39;s
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, &quot;How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?&quot;

&quot;Nearly three weeks.&quot;

&quot;And you saw him frequently?&quot;

&quot;Yes, almost every day.&quot;

&quot;His manners are very different from his cousin&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.&quot;

&quot;Indeed!&quot; cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. &quot;And pray
may I ask?&quot; but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, &quot;Is it in
address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style? for I dare not hope,&quot; he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, &quot;that he is improved in essentials.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.&quot;

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

&quot;When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.&quot;

Wickham&#39;s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

&quot;You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he
has very much at heart.&quot;

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.




CHAPTER XIX.


Had Elizabeth&#39;s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father&#39;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham&#39;s departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

&quot;But it is fortunate,&quot; thought she, &quot;that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister&#39;s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.&quot;

When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June
Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by
the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. &quot;But surely,&quot; said she, &quot;I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.&quot;

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt&#39;s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &amp;c. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

&quot;My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?&quot; said her aunt. &quot;A place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.&quot;

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. &quot;If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,&quot; said she, &quot;I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.&quot;

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk. But against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.

To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE.




CHAPTER I.


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth&#39;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

&quot;And of this place,&quot; thought she, &quot;I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,&quot;--recollecting
herself,--&quot;that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them.&quot;

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.

She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, &quot;but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends.&quot; How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master&#39;s steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--&quot;He is now gone into the army,&quot;
she added, &quot;but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.&quot;

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

&quot;And that,&quot; said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
&quot;is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.&quot;

&quot;I have heard much of your master&#39;s fine person,&quot; said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; &quot;it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.&quot;

Mrs. Reynolds&#39;s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

&quot;Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?&quot;

Elizabeth coloured, and said--&quot;A little.&quot;

&quot;And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Yes, very handsome.&quot;

&quot;I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master&#39;s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them.&quot;

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham&#39;s being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

&quot;And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?&quot; said Mr. Gardiner.

&quot;Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him.&quot;

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

&quot;Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?&quot;

&quot;Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.&quot;

&quot;Except,&quot; thought Elizabeth, &quot;when she goes to Ramsgate.&quot;

&quot;If your master would marry, you might see more of him.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him.&quot;

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, &quot;It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.&quot;

&quot;I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him,&quot; replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
&quot;I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four years old.&quot;

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

&quot;There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not
meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world.&quot;

Elizabeth almost stared at her.--&quot;Can this be Mr. Darcy!&quot; thought she.

&quot;His father was an excellent man,&quot; said Mrs. Gardiner.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.&quot;

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

&quot;He is the best landlord, and the best master,&quot; said she, &quot;that ever
lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men.&quot;

&quot;In what an amiable light does this place him!&quot; thought Elizabeth.

&quot;This fine account of him,&quot; whispered her aunt, as they walked, &quot;is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps we might be deceived.&quot;

&quot;That is not very likely; our authority was too good.&quot;

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at Pemberley.

&quot;He is certainly a good brother,&quot; said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy&#39;s delight, when she should enter
the room. &quot;And this is always the way with him,&quot; she added.--&quot;Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.&quot;

The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy&#39;s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father&#39;s life time.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth&#39;s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people&#39;s happiness were in his guardianship!--How
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener&#39;s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing&#39;s Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth&#39;s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words &quot;delightful,&quot; and &quot;charming,&quot; when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour
changed, and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself. &quot;What will be his surprise,&quot; thought
she, &quot;when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
fashion.&quot;

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, &quot;Why is he so altered? From
what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love
me.&quot;

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth&#39;s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband&#39;s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--&quot;for your housekeeper,&quot; she added, &quot;informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country.&quot; He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. &quot;They
will join me early to-morrow,&quot; he continued, &quot;and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.&quot;

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley&#39;s name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.

&quot;There is also one other person in the party,&quot; he continued after a
pause, &quot;who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?&quot;

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with
great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.
&quot;He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,&quot; said her uncle.

&quot;There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,&quot; replied her
aunt, &quot;but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it.&quot;

&quot;I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.&quot;

&quot;To be sure, Lizzy,&quot; said her aunt, &quot;he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not Wickham&#39;s countenance, for his features are
perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?&quot;

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

&quot;But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,&quot; replied
her uncle. &quot;Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.&quot;

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

&quot;From what we have seen of him,&quot; continued Mrs. Gardiner, &quot;I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured
look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a
liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue.&quot;

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham&#39;s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning&#39;s walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy&#39;s civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.




CHAPTER II.


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth&#39;s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley&#39;s quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth&#39;s anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love. Of the lady&#39;s sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it &quot;was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;&quot; and, before she could reply, he added, &quot;It
is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when
we were all dancing together at Netherfield.&quot;

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant&#39;s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy&#39;s, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.




CHAPTER III.


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley&#39;s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady&#39;s side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana&#39;s reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley&#39;s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley&#39;s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother&#39;s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

&quot;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.&quot;

In Darcy&#39;s presence she dared not mention Wickham&#39;s name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment&#39;s distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy&#39;s opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy&#39;s meditated
elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley&#39;s connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth&#39;s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth&#39;s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join
her. Her brother&#39;s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.

&quot;How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,&quot; she cried; &quot;I
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
should not have known her again.&quot;

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

&quot;For my own part,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.&quot;

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

&quot;I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, &#39;_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.&#39; But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, &quot;but _that_
was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.&quot;

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both. The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner
thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece&#39;s beginning the subject.




CHAPTER IV.


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

     &quot;Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to
     poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a
     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
     marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother
     is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be
     long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but I hardly know what I have written.&quot;

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

     &quot;By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
     for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
     Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
     Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia&#39;s short
     letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to
     Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
     that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
     was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to
     Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making
     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into
     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he
     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and
     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my
     dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,
     but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of Lydia&#39;s connections, which is not likely,
     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to
     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life
     saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I
     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,
     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have
     still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to
     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What
     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again
     to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle&#39;s advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.&quot;

&quot;Oh! where, where is my uncle?&quot; cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia&#39;s
situation, hastily exclaimed, &quot;I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; I have not an instant to lose.&quot;

&quot;Good God! what is the matter?&quot; cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, &quot;I will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself.&quot;

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
&quot;Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very
ill.&quot;

&quot;No, I thank you;&quot; she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. &quot;There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.&quot;

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length, she spoke again. &quot;I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together
from Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever.&quot;

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. &quot;When I consider,&quot; she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, &quot;that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew
what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what
I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all, all too late now.&quot;

&quot;I am grieved, indeed,&quot; cried Darcy; &quot;grieved--shocked. But is it
certain, absolutely certain?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.&quot;

&quot;And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?&quot;

&quot;My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle&#39;s
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But
nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!&quot;

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.

&quot;When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!&quot;

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, &quot;I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister&#39;s having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.&quot;

He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth&#39;s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia&#39;s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane&#39;s second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham&#39;s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now
feel it.

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle&#39;s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant&#39;s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. &quot;But what is to be
done about Pemberley?&quot; cried Mrs. Gardiner. &quot;John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?&quot;

&quot;Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.&quot;

&quot;That is all settled;&quot; repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. &quot;And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!&quot;

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.




CHAPTER V.


&quot;I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,&quot; said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; &quot;and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel&#39;s family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said Mrs. Gardiner, &quot;I begin to be of your uncle&#39;s
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?&quot;

&quot;Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect
I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the
case?&quot;

&quot;In the first place,&quot; replied Mr. Gardiner, &quot;there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.&quot;

&quot;Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.&quot;

&quot;Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.&quot;

&quot;But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane&#39;s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father&#39;s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.&quot;

&quot;But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?&quot;

&quot;It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,&quot; replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, &quot;that a sister&#39;s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.&quot;

&quot;But you see that Jane,&quot; said her aunt, &quot;does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.&quot;

&quot;Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word. That he has neither integrity nor honour. That he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.&quot;

&quot;And do you really know all this?&quot; cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

&quot;I do, indeed,&quot; replied Elizabeth, colouring. &quot;I told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.&quot;

&quot;But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight&#39;s time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it
was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts.&quot;

&quot;When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other.&quot;

&quot;Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites.&quot;

       *       *       *       *       *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth&#39;s thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother&#39;s apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
every thing will be well.&quot;

&quot;Is my father in town?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.&quot;

&quot;And have you heard from him often?&quot;

&quot;We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention.&quot;

&quot;And my mother--How is she? How are you all?&quot;

&quot;My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven! are quite well.&quot;

&quot;But you--How are you?&quot; cried Elizabeth. &quot;You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!&quot;

Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

&quot;If I had been able,&quot; said she, &quot;to carry my point of going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear
child! And now here&#39;s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do.&quot;

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

&quot;Do not give way to useless alarm,&quot; added he, &quot;though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.&quot;

&quot;Oh! my dear brother,&quot; replied Mrs. Bennet, &quot;that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.&quot;

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her
toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As
for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

&quot;This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation.&quot;

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
&quot;Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.&quot;

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, &quot;But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.&quot;

&quot;Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia&#39;s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.&quot;

&quot;And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?&quot;

&quot;Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.&quot;

&quot;And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?&quot;

&quot;How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister&#39;s happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia&#39;s last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks.&quot;

&quot;But not before they went to Brighton?&quot;

&quot;No, I believe not.&quot;

&quot;And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he
know his real character?&quot;

&quot;I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in
debt; but I hope this may be false.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!&quot;

&quot;Perhaps it would have been better;&quot; replied her sister. &quot;But to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.&quot;

&quot;Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia&#39;s note to his
wife?&quot;

&quot;He brought it with him for us to see.&quot;

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

     &quot;MY DEAR HARRIET,

     &quot;You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my
     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
     will drink to our good journey.

     &quot;Your affectionate friend,

     &quot;LYDIA BENNET.&quot;

&quot;Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!&quot; cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. &quot;What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!&quot;

&quot;I never saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!&quot;

&quot;Oh! Jane,&quot; cried Elizabeth, &quot;was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?&quot;

&quot;I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties.&quot;

&quot;Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.&quot;

&quot;Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us.&quot;

&quot;She had better have stayed at home,&quot; cried Elizabeth; &quot;perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one&#39;s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.&quot;

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

&quot;He meant, I believe,&quot; replied Jane, &quot;to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady&#39;s removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.&quot;




CHAPTER VI.


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband&#39;s not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham&#39;s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman&#39;s family.
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister&#39;s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect.

&quot;I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man&#39;s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we
have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts,
perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person.&quot;

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.

She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning&#39;s impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

     &quot;MY DEAR SIR,

     &quot;I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent&#39;s mind. The death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
     And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined
     by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,
     to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.

     &quot;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot;

Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia&#39;s relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr.
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family; Jane heard them with horror. &quot;A gamester!&quot; she cried. &quot;This is
wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.&quot;

Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law&#39;s intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

&quot;What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!&quot; she cried. &quot;Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?&quot;

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia&#39;s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, &quot;Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.&quot;

&quot;You must not be too severe upon yourself,&quot; replied Elizabeth.

&quot;You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.&quot;

&quot;Do you suppose them to be in London?&quot;

&quot;Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?&quot;

&quot;And Lydia used to want to go to London,&quot; added Kitty.

&quot;She is happy, then,&quot; said her father, drily; &quot;and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.&quot;

Then, after a short silence, he continued, &quot;Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind.&quot;

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother&#39;s
tea.

&quot;This is a parade,&quot; cried he, &quot;which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.&quot;

&quot;I am not going to run away, Papa,&quot; said Kitty, fretfully; &quot;if _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.&quot;

&quot;_You_ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.&quot;

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; said he, &quot;do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.&quot;




CHAPTER VII.


Two days after Mr. Bennet&#39;s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, &quot;I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.&quot;

&quot;Dear madam,&quot; cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, &quot;don&#39;t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.&quot;

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

&quot;If you are looking for my master, ma&#39;am, he is walking towards the
little copse.&quot;

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

&quot;Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.&quot;

&quot;Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?&quot;

&quot;What is there of good to be expected?&quot; said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; &quot;but perhaps you would like to read it.&quot;

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

&quot;Read it aloud,&quot; said their father, &quot;for I hardly know myself what it is
about.&quot;

     &quot;Gracechurch-street, Monday,

     August 2.

     &quot;MY DEAR BROTHER,

     &quot;At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet.
     It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them
     both----&quot;

&quot;Then it is, as I always hoped,&quot; cried Jane; &quot;they are married!&quot;

     Elizabeth read on; &quot;I have seen them both. They are not married,
     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham&#39;s
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will
     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on. Your&#39;s, &amp;c.

     &quot;EDW. GARDINER.&quot;

&quot;Is it possible!&quot; cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. &quot;Can it be
possible that he will marry her?&quot;

&quot;Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;&quot; said her
sister. &quot;My dear father, I congratulate you.&quot;

&quot;And have you answered the letter?&quot; said Elizabeth.

&quot;No; but it must be done soon.&quot;

Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

&quot;Oh! my dear father,&quot; she cried, &quot;come back, and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.&quot;

&quot;Let me write for you,&quot; said Jane, &quot;if you dislike the trouble
yourself.&quot;

&quot;I dislike it very much,&quot; he replied; &quot;but it must be done.&quot;

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

&quot;And may I ask?&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.&quot;

&quot;Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.&quot;

&quot;And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am
ever to pay him.&quot;

&quot;Money! my uncle!&quot; cried Jane, &quot;what do you mean, Sir?&quot;

&quot;I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.&quot;

&quot;That is very true,&quot; said Elizabeth; &quot;though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle&#39;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said her father, &quot;Wickham&#39;s a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.&quot;

&quot;Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?&quot;

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

&quot;And they are really to be married!&quot; cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. &quot;How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!&quot;

&quot;I comfort myself with thinking,&quot; replied Jane, &quot;that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has
children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?&quot;

&quot;If we are ever able to learn what Wickham&#39;s debts have been,&quot; said
Elizabeth, &quot;and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!&quot;

&quot;We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,&quot; said
Jane: &quot;I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Their conduct has been such,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;as neither you, nor
I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.&quot;

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

&quot;Just as you please.&quot;

&quot;May we take my uncle&#39;s letter to read to her?&quot;

&quot;Take whatever you like, and get away.&quot;

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly
contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner&#39;s hope of Lydia&#39;s
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know
that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

&quot;My dear, dear Lydia!&quot; she cried: &quot;This is delightful indeed!--She will
be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My
good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage
every thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!&quot;

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner&#39;s behaviour laid them all under.

&quot;For we must attribute this happy conclusion,&quot; she added, &quot;in a great
measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist Mr. Wickham with money.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; cried her mother, &quot;it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can&#39;t write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.&quot;

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day&#39;s delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.

&quot;I will go to Meryton,&quot; said she, &quot;as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any
thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.&quot;

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia&#39;s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.




CHAPTER VIII.


Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia&#39;s birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband&#39;s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother&#39;s hands, Lydia&#39;s expences had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.

The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

&quot;Haye-Park might do,&quot; said she, &quot;if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.&quot;

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, &quot;Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.&quot;

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter&#39;s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister&#39;s
frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia&#39;s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet&#39;s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the Militia.

     &quot;It was greatly my wish that he should do so,&quot; he added, &quot;as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece&#39;s. It is Mr. Wickham&#39;s intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the
     promise of an ensigncy in General ----&#39;s regiment, now quartered in
     the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope
     at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from
     Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--Your&#39;s, &amp;c.

     &quot;E. GARDINER.&quot;

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham&#39;s removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&#39;s being settled in the
North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.

&quot;She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,&quot; said she, &quot;it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----&#39;s
regiment.&quot;

His daughter&#39;s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister&#39;s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.




CHAPTER IX.


Their sister&#39;s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia&#39;s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

&quot;Only think of its being three months,&quot; she cried, &quot;since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.&quot;

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, &quot;Oh! mamma, do the
people here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might
not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
any thing.&quot;

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother&#39;s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, &quot;Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman.&quot;

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called &quot;Mrs. Wickham,&quot; by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

&quot;Well, mamma,&quot; said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, &quot;and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my
good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.&quot;

&quot;Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don&#39;t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?&quot;

&quot;Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.&quot;

&quot;I should like it beyond any thing!&quot; said her mother.

&quot;And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.&quot;

&quot;I thank you for my share of the favour,&quot; said Elizabeth; &quot;but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.&quot;

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham&#39;s affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia&#39;s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

&quot;Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?&quot;

&quot;No really,&quot; replied Elizabeth; &quot;I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.&quot;

&quot;La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement&#39;s, because Wickham&#39;s lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o&#39;clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my
aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten,
for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.

&quot;Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you&#39;ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was
rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Darcy!&quot; repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

&quot;Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!&quot;

&quot;If it was to be secret,&quot; said Jane, &quot;say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.&quot;

&quot;Oh! certainly,&quot; said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; &quot;we will
ask you no questions.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Lydia, &quot;for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.&quot;

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
sister&#39;s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

&quot;You may readily comprehend,&quot; she added, &quot;what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.&quot;

&quot;Not that I _shall_ though,&quot; she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; &quot;and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.&quot;

Jane&#39;s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.




CHAPTER X.


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

     &quot;Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.

     &quot;MY DEAR NIECE,

     &quot;I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
     Don&#39;t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming
     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.
     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all
     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your&#39;s_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
     once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that Wickham&#39;s worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character
     was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never
     disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----
     street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of Lydia&#39;s flight, on her own folly alone. He
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to
     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.
     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy&#39;s next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner
     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and
     then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor
     was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,
     what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,
     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham&#39;s character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody&#39;s_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to
     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was
     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane&#39;s letter
     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear
     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive
     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
     have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.
     The children have been wanting me this half hour. Your&#39;s, very
     sincerely,

     &quot;M. GARDINER.&quot;

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister&#39;s
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how
much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing
to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself. She read over her aunt&#39;s commendation of him
again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one&#39;s
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

&quot;I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?&quot; said he,
as he joined her.

&quot;You certainly do,&quot; she replied with a smile; &quot;but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.&quot;

&quot;I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends;
and now we are better.&quot;

&quot;True. Are the others coming out?&quot;

&quot;I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.&quot;

She replied in the affirmative.

&quot;I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she did.&quot;

&quot;And what did she say?&quot;

&quot;That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

&quot;I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,&quot; said
Elizabeth. &quot;It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.&quot;

&quot;Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.&quot;

&quot;Yes; he introduced us to his sister.&quot;

&quot;And do you like her?&quot;

&quot;Very much.&quot;

&quot;I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.&quot;

&quot;I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.&quot;

&quot;Did you go by the village of Kympton?&quot;

&quot;I do not recollect that we did.&quot;

&quot;I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect.&quot;

&quot;How should you have liked making sermons?&quot;

&quot;Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?&quot;

&quot;I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.&quot;

&quot;You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.&quot;

&quot;I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.&quot;

&quot;You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.&quot;

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister&#39;s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

&quot;Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.&quot;

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.




CHAPTER XI.


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia&#39;s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

&quot;Oh! my dear Lydia,&quot; she cried, &quot;when shall we meet again?&quot;

&quot;Oh, lord! I don&#39;t know. Not these two or three years perhaps.&quot;

&quot;Write to me very often, my dear.&quot;

&quot;As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.&quot;

Mr. Wickham&#39;s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife&#39;s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

&quot;He is as fine a fellow,&quot; said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, &quot;as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law.&quot;

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

&quot;I often think,&quot; said she, &quot;that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one&#39;s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.&quot;

&quot;This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,&quot; said
Elizabeth. &quot;It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.&quot;

&quot;It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband&#39;s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.&quot;

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation. The
housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.

&quot;Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,&quot; (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news.) &quot;Well, so much the better. Not that
I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
_I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?&quot;

&quot;You may depend on it,&quot; replied the other, &quot;for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher&#39;s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed.&quot;

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

&quot;I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don&#39;t imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt
that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid
of _myself_, but I dread other people&#39;s remarks.&quot;

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend&#39;s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

&quot;Yet it is hard,&quot; she sometimes thought, &quot;that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.&quot;

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

&quot;As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, &quot;you
will wait on him of course.&quot;

&quot;No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool&#39;s errand again.&quot;

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

&quot;&#39;Tis an etiquette I despise,&quot; said he. &quot;If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again.&quot;

&quot;Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him. But, however, that shan&#39;t prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him.&quot;

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband&#39;s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did. As the day of his arrival drew near,

&quot;I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,&quot; said Jane to her sister. &quot;It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!&quot;

&quot;I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,&quot; replied Elizabeth; &quot;but
it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much.&quot;

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

&quot;There is a gentleman with him, mamma,&quot; said Kitty; &quot;who can it be?&quot;

&quot;Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.&quot;

&quot;La!&quot; replied Kitty, &quot;it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what&#39;s his name. That tall, proud man.&quot;

&quot;Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley&#39;s will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.&quot;

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley&#39;s friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner&#39;s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

&quot;Let me first see how he behaves,&quot; said she; &quot;it will then be early
enough for expectation.&quot;

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen&#39;s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother&#39;s
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.

&quot;Could I expect it to be otherwise!&quot; said she. &quot;Yet why did he come?&quot;

She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.

&quot;It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

&quot;I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, &#39;Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,&#39; without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.
It was my brother Gardiner&#39;s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?&quot;

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

&quot;It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,&quot;
continued her mother, &quot;but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.&quot;

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

&quot;When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,&quot; said her mother,
&quot;I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.
Bennet&#39;s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you.&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.

&quot;The first wish of my heart,&quot; said she to herself, &quot;is never more to be
in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!&quot;

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

&quot;You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,&quot; she added, &quot;for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.&quot;

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.




CHAPTER XII.


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy&#39;s behaviour astonished and vexed her.

&quot;Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,&quot; said she,
&quot;did he come at all?&quot;

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

&quot;He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will
think no more about him.&quot;

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

&quot;Now,&quot; said she, &quot;that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.&quot;

&quot;Yes, very indifferent indeed,&quot; said Elizabeth, laughingly. &quot;Oh, Jane,
take care.&quot;

&quot;My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now.&quot;

&quot;I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.&quot;

       *       *       *       *       *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour&#39;s visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane&#39;s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother&#39;s ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth&#39;s mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

&quot;If he does not come to me, _then_,&quot; said she, &quot;I shall give him up for
ever.&quot;

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen&#39;s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

&quot;The men shan&#39;t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?&quot;

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!

&quot;A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!&quot;

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

&quot;Is your sister at Pemberley still?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.&quot;

&quot;And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?&quot;

&quot;Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.&quot;

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady&#39;s whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother&#39;s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

&quot;Well girls,&quot; said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, &quot;What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucas&#39;s last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? &#39;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.&#39; She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley&#39;s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

&quot;It has been a very agreeable day,&quot; said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. &quot;The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.&quot;

Elizabeth smiled.

&quot;Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man.&quot;

&quot;You are very cruel,&quot; said her sister, &quot;you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.&quot;

&quot;How hard it is in some cases to be believed!&quot;

&quot;And how impossible in others!&quot;

&quot;But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?&quot;

&quot;That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante.&quot;




CHAPTER XIII.


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

&quot;Next time you call,&quot; said she, &quot;I hope we shall be more lucky.&quot;

He should be particularly happy at any time, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

&quot;Can you come to-morrow?&quot;

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter&#39;s room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

&quot;My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come.--He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy&#39;s hair.&quot;

&quot;We will be down as soon as we can,&quot; said Jane; &quot;but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
where is your sash my dear?&quot;

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, &quot;What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?&quot;

&quot;Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.&quot; She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

&quot;Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,&quot; took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.
In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,

&quot;Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.&quot;

Elizabeth was forced to go.

&quot;We may as well leave them by themselves you know;&quot; said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. &quot;Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.&quot;

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet&#39;s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet&#39;s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman&#39;s
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet&#39;s invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother&#39;s schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her&#39;s_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

&quot;&#39;Tis too much!&quot; she added, &quot;by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not every body as happy?&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.

&quot;I must go instantly to my mother;&quot; she cried. &quot;I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!&quot;

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

&quot;And this,&quot; said she, &quot;is the end of all his friend&#39;s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister&#39;s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!&quot;

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

&quot;Where is your sister?&quot; said he hastily, as he opened the door.

&quot;With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say.&quot;

He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane&#39;s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet&#39;s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

&quot;Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.&quot;

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

&quot;You are a good girl;&quot; he replied, &quot;and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.&quot;

&quot;I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_.&quot;

&quot;Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; cried his wife, &quot;what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more.&quot; Then addressing her daughter, &quot;Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I sha&#39;nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!&quot;

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

&quot;He has made me so happy,&quot; said she, one evening, &quot;by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
believed it possible.&quot;

&quot;I suspected as much,&quot; replied Elizabeth. &quot;But how did he account for
it?&quot;

&quot;It must have been his sister&#39;s doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other.&quot;

&quot;That is the most unforgiving speech,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley&#39;s pretended regard.&quot;

&quot;Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!&quot;

&quot;He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.&quot;

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.

Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

&quot;I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!&quot; cried
Jane. &quot;Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!&quot;

&quot;If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.&quot;

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.




CHAPTER XIV.


One morning, about a week after Bingley&#39;s engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth&#39;s salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship&#39;s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

&quot;I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.&quot;

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

&quot;And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.&quot;

&quot;Yes, madam,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.
&quot;She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who I believe will soon become a part of the family.&quot;

&quot;You have a very small park here,&quot; returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

&quot;It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.&quot;

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

&quot;May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.&quot;

&quot;Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.&quot;

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,

&quot;Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.&quot;

&quot;Go, my dear,&quot; cried her mother, &quot;and shew her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.&quot;

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

&quot;How could I ever think her like her nephew?&quot; said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

&quot;You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.&quot;

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

&quot;Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.&quot;

&quot;Miss Bennet,&quot; replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, &quot;you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.&quot;

&quot;If you believed it impossible to be true,&quot; said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, &quot;I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?&quot;

&quot;At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.&quot;

&quot;Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,&quot; said Elizabeth,
coolly, &quot;will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.&quot;

&quot;If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?&quot;

&quot;I never heard that it was.&quot;

&quot;And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?&quot;

&quot;I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _You_
may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer.&quot;

&quot;This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?&quot;

&quot;Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.&quot;

&quot;It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.&quot;

&quot;If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.&quot;

&quot;Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.&quot;

&quot;But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit.&quot;

&quot;Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?&quot;

&quot;Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.&quot;

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

&quot;The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her&#39;s. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?&quot;

&quot;Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.&quot;

&quot;These are heavy misfortunes,&quot; replied Elizabeth. &quot;But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.&quot;

&quot;Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score?

&quot;Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be
dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person&#39;s whims.
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.&quot;

&quot;_That_ will make your ladyship&#39;s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_.&quot;

&quot;I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father&#39;s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both
sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up.&quot;

&quot;In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&#39;s daughter; so far we are
equal.&quot;

&quot;True. You _are_ a gentleman&#39;s daughter. But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.&quot;

&quot;Whatever my connections may be,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.&quot;

&quot;Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?&quot;

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment&#39;s deliberation,

&quot;I am not.&quot;

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

&quot;And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?&quot;

&quot;I will make no promise of the kind.&quot;

&quot;Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance I require.&quot;

&quot;And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject.&quot;

&quot;Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister&#39;s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man&#39;s marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew&#39;s sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father&#39;s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?&quot;

&quot;You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,&quot; she resentfully answered.
&quot;You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.&quot;

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

&quot;You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?&quot;

&quot;Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.&quot;

&quot;You are then resolved to have him?&quot;

&quot;I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.&quot;

&quot;It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.&quot;

&quot;Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,&quot; replied Elizabeth, &quot;have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment&#39;s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.&quot;

&quot;And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.&quot;

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

&quot;I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.&quot;

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

&quot;She did not choose it,&quot; said her daughter, &quot;she would go.&quot;

&quot;She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?&quot;

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.




CHAPTER XV.


The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.

In revolving lady Catherine&#39;s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

&quot;If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days,&quot; she added, &quot;I shall know how to
understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.&quot;

       *       *       *       *       *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet&#39;s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

&quot;Lizzy,&quot; said he, &quot;I was going to look for you; come into my room.&quot;

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,

&quot;I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest.&quot;

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth&#39;s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

&quot;You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.&quot;

&quot;From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?&quot;

&quot;Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. &quot;Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land.&quot;

&quot;Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?&quot; &quot;This young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman&#39;s proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.&quot;

&quot;Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.&quot;

&quot;My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.&quot;

&quot;_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!&quot;

Elizabeth tried to join in her father&#39;s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

&quot;Are you not diverted?&quot;

&quot;Oh! yes. Pray read on.&quot;

&quot;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&quot; &quot;Mr.
Collins moreover adds,&quot; &quot;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&#39;s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing.&quot; &quot;_That_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte&#39;s
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Elizabeth, &quot;I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!&quot;

&quot;Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins&#39;s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?&quot;

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy&#39;s indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.




CHAPTER XVI.


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine&#39;s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

&quot;Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your&#39;s. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,&quot; replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, &quot;that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.
Gardiner was so little to be trusted.&quot;

&quot;You must not blame my aunt. Lydia&#39;s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.&quot;

&quot;If you _will_ thank me,&quot; he replied, &quot;let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought
only of _you_.&quot;

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, &quot;You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.&quot;

Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship&#39;s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

&quot;It taught me to hope,&quot; said he, &quot;as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.&quot;

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, &quot;Yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.&quot;

&quot;What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.&quot;

&quot;We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.&quot;

&quot;I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &#39;had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.&#39; Those were your words. You know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.&quot;

&quot;I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.&quot;

&quot;I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me.&quot;

&quot;Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.&quot;

Darcy mentioned his letter. &quot;Did it,&quot; said he, &quot;did it _soon_ make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?&quot;

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

&quot;I knew,&quot; said he, &quot;that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.&quot;

&quot;The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.&quot;

&quot;When I wrote that letter,&quot; replied Darcy, &quot;I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.&quot;

&quot;The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.&quot;

&quot;I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.&quot;

&quot;Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.&quot;

&quot;My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?&quot;

&quot;Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction.&quot;

&quot;I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?&quot;

&quot;No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.&quot;

&quot;Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.&quot;

&quot;My object _then_,&quot; replied Darcy, &quot;was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.&quot;

He then told her of Georgiana&#39;s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

&quot;What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!&quot; was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

&quot;I must ask whether you were surprised?&quot; said Elizabeth.

&quot;Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.&quot;

&quot;That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.&quot; And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

&quot;On the evening before my going to London,&quot; said he &quot;I made a confession
to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the
slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.&quot;

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

&quot;Did you speak from your own observation,&quot; said she, &quot;when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?&quot;

&quot;From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.&quot;

&quot;And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.&quot;

&quot;It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister&#39;s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.&quot;

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.




CHAPTER XVII.


&quot;My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?&quot; was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet&#39;s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

&quot;You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.&quot;

&quot;This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged.&quot;

Jane looked at her doubtingly. &quot;Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.&quot;

&quot;You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.&quot;

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

&quot;Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,&quot; cried
Jane. &quot;My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?&quot;

&quot;There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?&quot;

&quot;Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.&quot;

&quot;My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious. I want to talk very seriously.
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?&quot;

&quot;It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.&quot;

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish.

&quot;Now I am quite happy,&quot; said she, &quot;for you will be as happy as myself. I
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley&#39;s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it, to another, not to you.&quot;

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in Lydia&#39;s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

       *       *       *       *       *

&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, &quot;if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley&#39;s
way.&quot;

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, &quot;Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?&quot;

&quot;I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,&quot; said Mrs. Bennet, &quot;to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.&quot;

&quot;It may do very well for the others,&quot; replied Mr. Bingley; &quot;but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?&quot;

Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
saying,

&quot;I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane&#39;s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.&quot;

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet&#39;s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother&#39;s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father&#39;s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, &quot;Go to your father, he
wants you in the library.&quot; She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
&quot;Lizzy,&quot; said he, &quot;what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?&quot;

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

&quot;Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?&quot;

&quot;Have you any other objection,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;than your belief of my
indifference?&quot;

&quot;None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.&quot;

&quot;I do, I do like him,&quot; she replied, with tears in her eyes, &quot;I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.&quot;

&quot;Lizzy,&quot; said her father, &quot;I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.&quot;

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father&#39;s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said he, when she ceased speaking, &quot;I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.&quot;

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

&quot;This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&#39;s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle&#39;s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&quot;

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins&#39;s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, &quot;If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour&#39;s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.

&quot;Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane&#39;s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.&quot;

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

&quot;My dearest child,&quot; she cried, &quot;I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! &#39;Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.&quot;

This was a sad omen of what her mother&#39;s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations&#39;
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

&quot;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,&quot; said he. &quot;Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane&#39;s.&quot;




CHAPTER XVIII.


Elizabeth&#39;s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. &quot;How could
you begin?&quot; said she. &quot;I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?&quot;

&quot;I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.&quot;

&quot;My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?&quot;

&quot;For the liveliness of your mind, I did.&quot;

&quot;You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.&quot;

&quot;Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?&quot;

&quot;Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?&quot;

&quot;Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.&quot;

&quot;But I was embarrassed.&quot;

&quot;And so was I.&quot;

&quot;You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.&quot;

&quot;A man who had felt less, might.&quot;

&quot;How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject? This will never do.&quot;

&quot;You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine&#39;s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your&#39;s. My aunt&#39;s intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.&quot;

&quot;Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?&quot;

&quot;My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.&quot;

&quot;Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to
befall her?&quot;

&quot;I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly.&quot;

&quot;And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.&quot;

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner&#39;s
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     &quot;I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than
     really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I
     be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.
     We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in
     the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I
     laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.

     Your&#39;s, &amp;c.&quot;

Mr. Darcy&#39;s letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in
reply to his last.

     &quot;DEAR SIR,

     &quot;I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as
     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has
     more to give.

     &quot;Your&#39;s sincerely, &amp;c.&quot;

Miss Bingley&#39;s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother&#39;s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew&#39;s letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James&#39;s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Philips&#39;s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley&#39;s good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.




CHAPTER XIX.


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia&#39;s example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia&#39;s
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet&#39;s being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters&#39; beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

     &quot;MY DEAR LIZZY,

     &quot;I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.

     &quot;Yours, &amp;c.&quot;

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her&#39;s lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth&#39;s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley&#39;s good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy&#39;s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana&#39;s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way. By Elizabeth&#39;s instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth&#39;s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,
as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
